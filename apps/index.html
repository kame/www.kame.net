<H1>KAME IPv6-patched applications</H1>

<PRE>$Id: index.html,v 1.2 2001/06/05 22:49:42 itojun Exp $</PRE>

We KAME group make many patchkits for making popular applications IPv6-ready.
Our collection includes famous mozilla, apache, cvs, python, perl, ucd-snmp,
and other random applications, you-name-it.
<P>

Application patches can be found at
<A HREF=ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/misc/><TT>ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/misc/
</TT></A> and its <A HREF=../snap-users/>mirrors</A>.

<H2>Accessing cvs repository</H2>

We work on these patches on temporary working area in our cvs repository.
If you are in hurry, or you would like to keep track of those changes easily,
you may want to use anonymous CVS, rather than the finished patch kit.
Please, however, notice the following facts:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Code in the repository is an unfinished work.</STRONG><BR>
	Please do not route questions about the content of the
	repository, if you are unsure about the status.
	When reporting bugs, please check finished patchkit in
	<A HREF=ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/misc/><TT>
	ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/misc/</TT></A>.
	If we do not issue patchkit, that means we do not have a working
	version for that.

<LI><STRONG>Content on the repository are not supposed to work in many cases.
	</STRONG><BR>
	For example, in case we imported third-party applications into
	repository but had no time to tackle, the repository will not do
	much help.
<LI><STRONG>Sometimes they are obsolete.</STRONG><BR>
	We try to submit these patchkit to the original author as possible,
	so that it will be merged into the main distribution.
	We do not maintain patchkit after the merge, and in this case
	content of repository will be obsolete (and left as is),
<LI><STRONG>They may not be based on the most recent version.</STRONG><BR>
	We try to base our patchkit on the most recent "released" version
	of a third-party software.
	Because of this, we do not usually try to hack alpha versions.
<LI><STRONG>Please be sure to join snap-users mailing list</STRONG><BR>
	For announcements and updates.
