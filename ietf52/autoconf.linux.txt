For IPv6 autoconfiguration of your interface,
please confirm the below items.

/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/[your_interface]/forwarding = 0
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/[your_interface]/accept_ra  = 1

Then you might enable your interface using dhcp client or
"ifconfig [your_interface] up", you can get autoconfiguration.


But original Linux kernel has a bug of joining all-node
multicast address. If you can't get autoconfiguration in spite of
enabling your interface, you have to once unplug and re-plug
your interface or UTP cable.

If you have applied USAGI patch, you will get autoconfiguration
without trouble :-)


BTW, if you use pcmcia-cs-3.1.24 and your wireless card doesn't
work with IPv6, apply the patch from Heikki Vatiainen.
