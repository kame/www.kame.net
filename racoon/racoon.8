NAME
     racoon - IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) key management daemon

SYNOPSIS
     racoon [-BdFv46] [-f configfile] [-l logfile] [-p isakmp-port]

DESCRIPTION
     racoon speaks IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) key management protocol, to establish
     security association with other hosts.  SPD (Security Policy Database) in
     the kernel usually triggers to start racoon.  racoon usually sends all of
     informational messages, warnings and error messages to syslogd(8) with
     the facility LOG_DAEMON, the priority LOG_INFO.  Debugging messages are
     sent with the priority LOG_DEBUG.	You should configure syslog.conf(5)
     appropriately to see these messages.

     -B   Install SA(s) from the file which is specified in racoon.conf(5).

     -d   Increase the debug level.  Multiple -d will increase the debug level
	  even more.

     -F   Run racoon in the foreground.

     -f configfile
	  Use configfile as the configuration file instead of the default.

     -l logfile
	  Use logfile as the logging file instead of syslogd(8).

     -p isakmp-port
	  Listen to ISAKMP key exchange on port isakmp-port instead of the
	  default port number, 500.

     -v   The flag causes the packet dump be more verbose, with higher debug-
	  ging level.

     -4

     -6   Specifies the default address family for the sockets.

     racoon assumes the presence of kernel random number device rnd(4) at
     /dev/urandom.  Informational messages are labeled info, and debugging
     messages are labeled debug.  You have to configure syslog.conf(5) if you
     want to see them in a logging file.

FILES
