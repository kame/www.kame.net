<p>
To install OpenSSL, you just type `Configure' with the OS name you use,
and type `make install'.

<p>
To install SSLeay, if you are not USA resident, set variable USA_RESIDENT to NO,
and let's make install.

<p>
For FreeBSD and NetBSD, OpenSSL ports is ready.
But, You may think to get new OpenSSL package as possible.
You put new SSLeay packages into /usr/ports/distfiles, and change the directory into /usr/ports/security/SSLeay.

You must modify DISTNAME in Makefile like below,<br>

<blockquote><tt>
DISTNAME= SSLeay-0.9.0b
</tt></blockquote>

`SSLeay-0.9.0b' is latest package name.  Then you type linke below,

<blockquote><tt>
% make NO_CHECKSUM=yes install
</tt></blockquote>

But it may be rejected some patches, so you may patch manually,
and you type below,

<blockquote><tt>
% make NO_CHECKSUM=yes NO_PATCH=yes install
</tt></blockquote>

In FreeBSD 2.2.8 or later,

<blockquote><tt>
% make NO_CHECKSUM=yes -ik install
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
You type `./configure' to check and to build appropreate Makefile.
And Just type `make'.
