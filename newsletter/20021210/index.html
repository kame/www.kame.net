o Abstract

   RFC2401 defines that the kernel must consults the Security Policy Database
   (SPD) about the way to handle all inbound and outbound traffic.
   The administrators or some applications need to maintain the SPD
   in the kernel.
   This document describes the messages to manage the SPD in the KAME stack.
   the messages is extended to the PF_KEY version 2 [RFC2367].

o Extended Header

   Two extension headers are defined in order to describe a security policy.
   The one is "Security policy extension header" that is to specify the way
   to process a traffic.  For example, it makes the kernel discard the traffic
   or it makes the kernel apply security protocols, like ESP, to the traffice.
   The another is "Security protocol extension header" is to specify the
   information about security protocol to be applyed.  This header is used
   only when security protocol is required by the security policy extension
   header.  For example, ESP tunnel mode is required and the addresses of
   the SA end-point is between A and B.

- Security policy extension header

   Security policy extension header specifies the way to process a traffic.
   this structure also includes the direction of a traffic.

   struct sadb_x_policy {
      u_int16_t sadb_x_policy_len;
      u_int16_t sadb_x_policy_exttype;
      u_int16_t sadb_x_policy_type;
      u_int8_t sadb_x_policy_dir;
      u_int8_t sadb_x_policy_reserved;
      u_int32_t sadb_x_policy_id;
      u_int32_t sadb_x_policy_reserved2;
   };
   /* sizeof(struct sadb_x_policy) == 16 */
   
   sadb_x_policy_len
      length of the header in 64 bit words.  it is always 2.

   sadb_x_policy_exttype
      the type of the header.  it is always 18.
   
      #define SADB_X_EXT_POLICY 18

   sadb_x_policy_type
      the type of the policy.  

      #define IPSEC_POLICY_DISCARD    0       /* discard the packet */
      #define IPSEC_POLICY_NONE       1       /* bypass IPsec engine */
      #define IPSEC_POLICY_IPSEC      2       /* pass to IPsec */
      #define IPSEC_POLICY_ENTRUST    3       /* consulting SPD if present. */
      #define IPSEC_POLICY_BYPASS     4       /* only for privileged socket. */

      both IPSEC_POLICY_ENTRUST and IPSEC_POLICY_BYPASS are not used, but
      for the socket API.

   sadb_x_policy_dir
      the direction of the packet which the policy matches with.

      #define IPSEC_DIR_INBOUND       1
      #define IPSEC_DIR_OUTBOUND      2

   sadb_x_policy_id
      the policy identifier.  the kernel assigns a number to each
      individual security policy.

   sadb_x_policy_reserved
   sadb_x_policy_reserved2
      reserved value.  it must be zeroed by the sender.

- Security protocol extension header

   Security protocol extension header specifies the information about a single
   SA.  This extension header is used only when security protocol is required.
   In other words, when sadb_x_policy_type in the security policy extension
   header is set IPSEC_POLICY_IPSEC, this extension header MUST be required.
   In the case of SA bundle, multiple Security protocol extension headers
   must exist in a single PF_KEY message.  The security protocol extension
   header of the most of innner SA is located to the top of these headers.
   For example, when ESP is applied to a outbound packet and then AH applys to
   to the packet, the packet format is like [IP|AH|ESP|data],
   the extension header about ESP must be placed first, then the extension
   header about AH must be next.
   A single security protocol extension header is constructed by two parts.
   First part specifies the security protocol to be used including
   the ipsec mode, the level of the SA and the SA identifier.
   Second part specifies the addresses of the end point of the security
   association.  The part must follows the first part.  The second part may
   not be needed when the ipsec mode is transport mode.
   Second part is constructed by the source IP address of the SA and
   immediately followed by the destination IP address of the SA.
   These are packed into two of sockaddr structures without any padding.
   sa_len MUST be set exact lenght of the sockaddr structure.
   Each length of the sockaddr structure are not aligned to 64 bits,
   Total length of the security protocol extension header MUST be aligned
   to 64bits.  The padding must be set zero.

   struct sadb_x_ipsecrequest {
     u_int16_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_len;
     u_int16_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_proto;
     u_int8_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_mode;
     u_int8_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_level;
     u_int16_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_reqid;
   };
   [total length of ipsec policy requests]
       = (sadb_x_policy_len * sizeof(uint64_t) - sizeof(struct sadb_x_policy))
   
   u_int16_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_len;
      length of the field in 64 bit words.

   u_int16_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_proto;
      the security protocol of the security association to be used.

      IPPROTO_ESP             50
      IPPROTO_AH              51
      IPPROTO_IPCOMP          108

   u_int8_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_mode;
      the protocol mode of the securitfy association to be used.

      IPSEC_MODE_ANY          0
      IPSEC_MODE_TRANSPORT    1
      IPSEC_MODE_TUNNEL       2

   u_int8_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_level;
      the security level of the security association to be used.

      #define IPSEC_LEVEL_DEFAULT     0       /* reference to system default */
      #define IPSEC_LEVEL_USE         1       /* use SA if present. */
      #define IPSEC_LEVEL_REQUIRE     2       /* require SA. */
      #define IPSEC_LEVEL_UNIQUE      3       /* unique SA. */

   u_int16_t sadb_x_ipsecrequest_reqid;
      the identifier of the security association to be used.
      this value MUST be zero when the security level is not IPSEC_LEVEL_UNIQUE.

o Extended Message
   
   the policy mangement message is always constructed by
   some of extension payloads defined by RFC2367 and two extensions
   which defined above.
   In the following description,
   a policy extension header is represented by "policy" and
   a ipsec policy extension header is represented by "request".

- SADB_X_SPDSETIDX

   the SADB_X_SPDSETIDX message allows a process to add only selector
   of the security policy entry to the SPD.
   when an IP datagram matches this selector, the kernel sends up
   the SADB_X_SPDACQUIRE message to a process listened to the socket.
   thus this entry will be triggered to start a negotiation to fill the
   parameters of the security policy.
   this entry will be updated by SADB_X_SPDUPDATE message.

   the message from a user process to the kernel is:
      <base, address(SD), (lifetime(H),) policy>

   the message from the kernel to a user process is:
      <base, address(SD), (lifetime(H),) policy>

   the message type is 20.
      #define SADB_X_SPDSETIDX  20

- SADB_X_SPDUPDATE

   the SADB_X_SPDUPDATE message allows a process to replace the parameters of
   an existing security policy entry.  this message is normaly used after
   the SADB_X_SPDSETIDX message.
   
   the message from a user process to the kernel is:
      <base, address(SD), (lifetime(H),) policy(, request(, request..))>

   the message from the kernel to a user process is:
      <base, address(SD), (lifetime(H),) policy(, request(, request..))>

   the message type is 13.
      #define SADB_X_SPDUPDATE  13

- SADB_X_SPDADD

   the SADB_X_SPDADD message allows a process to add a new security policy
   entry to the SPD.
   
   the message from a user process to the kernel is:
      <base, address(SD), (lifetime(H),) policy(, request(, request..))>

   the message from the kernel to a user process is:
      <base, address(SD), (lifetime(H),) policy(, request(, request..))>

   the message type is 14.
      #define SADB_X_SPDADD     14

- SADB_X_SPDDELETE

   the SADB_X_SPDDELETE message allows a process to delete a security policy
   entry from the SPD.  a selector is used to specify a single
   security policy entry.

   the message from a user process to the kernel is:
      <base, address(SD), policy(*)>
   policy(*) header does not need the value of the policy identifier.

   the message from the kernel to a user process is:
      <base, address(SD), policy(*)>

   the message type is 15.
      #define SADB_X_SPDDELETE  15

- SADB_X_SPDDELETE2

   the SADB_X_SPDDELETE2 message is nearly identical to the SADB_X_SPDDELETE
   message, except that it specifies the policy id.

   the message from a user process to the kernel is:
      <base, policy(*)>
   policy(*) header does not need the value of the direction.

   the message from the kernel to a user process is:
      <base, policy(*)>

   the message type is 22.
      #define SADB_X_SPDDELETE2 22

- SADB_X_SPDGET

   the SADB_X_SPDGET message allows a process to retrieve a copy of a security
   policy entry from the SPD.

   the message from a user process to the kernel is:
      <base, policy(*)>

   the message from the kernel to a user process is:
      <base, address(SD), (lifetime(H),) policy(, request(, request..))>

   the message type is 16.
      #define SADB_X_SPDGET     16

- SADB_X_SPDACQUIRE

   the SADB_X_SPDACQUIRE message is sent only by the kernel to the key socket
   listeners who have registered their key socket by the SADB_REGISTER message.
   The SADB_X_SPDACQUIRE message is triggered by an outbound packet
   that needs security policy but for which there is no applicable informatioin
   existing in the security policy which is added by SADB_X_SPDSETIDX.
   
   the message **from the kernel** to a user process is:
      <base, policy(*)>

   the message from a user process to the kernel is:

   the message type is 17.
      #define SADB_X_SPDACQUIRE 17

- SADB_X_SPDEXPIRE

   the kernel is responsible for tracking security policy expirations.
   If the limit of a security policy has expired,
   then the kernel issues an SADB_X_SPDEXPIRE message
   to all key socket listeners. 

   the message **from the kernel** to a user process is:
      <base, address(SD), lifetime(CH), policy>

   the message type is 21.
      #define SADB_X_SPDEXPIRE  21

- SADB_X_SPDDUMP

   the SADB_X_SPDDUMP message causes the kernel to dump all entries in
   the SPD.

   the message from a user process to the kernel is:
      <base>

   the message from the kernel to a user process is similar to SADB_DUMP.

   the message type is 18.
      #define SADB_X_SPDDUMP    18

- SADB_X_SPDFLUSH

   the SADB_X_SPDFLUSH message causes the kernel to delete all entries in
   the SPD.

   the message from a user process to the kernel is:
      <base>

   the message from the kernel to a user process is:
      <base>

   the message type is 19.
      #define SADB_X_SPDFLUSH   19

o Conclusion

   The policy management API of KAME stack should be revised.
   First reason is that the API is extended by KAME uniquely.
   Solaris, OpenBSD and Linux have own original interface
   for the policy management like the API which described
   by this document.  But they are not common.  The API should be
   standardized because the application chould be portable.

   Second reason is that the policy management API based on PF_KEY should
   be revised because PF_KEY is designed for the key management,
   not for the policy management.  We have to defined the requirement
   to manage the policy.  Then we find a approach to implement the API.

   There is the work to design the API of the policy management,
   aka PF_POLICY.  But the work is not active.
   This document will be startpoint to discuss and to design PF_POLICY.
