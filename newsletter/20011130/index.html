    <h1>KAME Mobile IPv6 How To</h1>
    <a href="mailto:keiichi@iij.ad.jp">Keiichi SHIMA</a> @ {<a href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME Project</a> | <a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/index-e.html">Internet Initiative Japan</a>}

    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      This documents decsribes the step-by-step instruction to use KAME
      Mobile IPv6(KAME/MIP6) features.  Since KAME/MIP6 is still under
      developping, these information may be outdated at the time when
      you are reading this document.  Please refer the latest
      documentation included in the KAME kit in such a case.
    </p>
      
    <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

    <p>
      Currently, Only FreeBSD is proved to work as a home agent and or
      a mobile node or a correspondent node.  We are also operating a
      NetBSD box as a home agent (and, of course, as a correspondent
      node).  It seems working but not tested in a heavy load/various
      environment.  The mobile node functions are not tested on NetBSD
      yet.  Other BSDs (OpenBSD and BSD/OS) is not tested yet.
    </p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <p>
      KAME/MIP6 is under developping.  You should use the latest KAME
      snap kit always.  Get the latest kit from the <a
      href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME Project website</a>
    </p>      

    <h2>Compile with MIP6 extention</h2>
    
    <p>
      MIP6 is not enabled by default.  You should prepare a new kernel
      configuration file and rebuild your kernel that is able to speak
      the MIP6 protocol.  Also, some user-space commands need
      recompilation.  Follow the instruction below.
    </p>

    <h3>recompile your kernel</h3>

    <p>
      To enable MIP6 features, specify following kernel options in
      your kernel configuration file and recompile the kernel.
    </p>
    <pre>
options MIP6
options MIP6_DEBUG
options MIP6_ALLOW_COA_FALLBACK
pseudo-device hif 1
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you specify <samp>MIP6_DEBUG</samp>, the kernel will print
      many debuging messages.  Though it may be annoying you, it is
      very useful when you encounter some problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <samp>MIP6_ALLOW_COA_FALLBACK</samp> enables the CoA fallback
      feature.  In the MIP6 specification, the author decreres that
      all IPv6 node must support the home address destination option.
      But, there are not so many implementations those support the
      option.  If the peer doesn't recognizes the home address
      destination option, the mobile node can't communicate with that
      node.  If you specify <samp>MIP6_ALLOW_COA_FALLBACK</samp>, the
      kernel will try to use its home address as a source address
      <em>WITHOUT</em> the home address destination option.  If this
      approach fails or in the next time to connect to the same peer,
      the kernel will use CoA as its source address.  Yes, I know that
      the former violates MIP6 specification and the latter make the
      mobile node from moving from one network to another network,
      though, it is very useful in such a transision period that not
      all implementation support the home address destination option.

    <h3>Build user-space commands</h3>

    <p>
      There are two user-space commands related to MIP6.  One is
      <samp>rtadvd</samp> and the other is <samp>mip6control</samp>.
      If you want to have a home agent, you must rebuild
      <samp>rtadvd</samp> with <samp>MIP6</samp> option.
      <samp>mip6control</samp> is a controll command of KAME/MIP6
      functions.  All users need to build <samp>mip6control</samp> to
      use KAME/MIP6.
    </p>

    <h4>recompile <samp>rtadvd</samp></h4>
    
    <p>
      Go to the directory of <samp>rtadvd</samp>
      (<samp>${KAME}/freebsd4/sbin/rtadvd/</samp> for FreeBSD), add
      the following line to <samp>Makefile</samp>
    </p>
    <pre>
CFLAGS+=-DMIP6
    </pre>
    Recompile <samp>rtadvd</samp> and install it.
    <pre>
$ make clean
$ make
$ su (become the super user)
# make install
    </pre>

    <h4>build <samp>mip6control</samp></h4>

    <p>
      There is no operating specific directory for
      <samp>mip6control</samp>.  Goto
      <samp>${KAME}/kame/kame/mip6control/</samp> and just make.
    </p>
    <pre>
$ make
$ su (become the super user)
# make install
    </pre>
    <p>
      The latest KAME/FreeBSD4 will automatically compile
      <samp>mip6control</samp> and install it to proper position.
    </p>

    <h2>Set up a home agent</h2>

    <p>
      To become a home agent, complete the following settings.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>prepare <samp>rtadvd.conf</samp> for a home agent</li>
      <li>invoke <samp>rtadvd</samp> with <samp>-m</samp> flag
      <li>home agent subnet anycast address</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prepare <samp>rtadvd.conf</samp> for a home agent</h3>

    <pre>
fxp0:\
        :maxinterval#60:mininterval#40:\
        :raflags#32:\
        :pinfoflags#224:\
        :addrs#1:addr="2001:200:0:0:0123:4567:89ab:cdef":
    </pre>
    <p>
      The point of the configuration is flags and address(es) of the
      prefix infomation.  <samp>raflags</samp> specifies a home agent
      bit (third highest bit).  <samp>pinfoflags</samp> specifies a
      router address bit (third highest bit).  <samp>addrs#1</samp>
      specifies the address of this home agent.  This must be a full
      ipv6 address (not only the netowrk prefix of this link) of the
      home agent.
    </p>

    <h3>Invoke <samp>rtadvd</samp></h3>
    
    <p>
      Invoke rtadvd with <samp>-m</samp> option.  This option enables
      MIP6 feature of rtadvd.
    </p>

    <h3>Assign home agent subnet anycast address</h3>

    <p>
      Assigning a home agent subnet anycast address makes it possible
      to do DHAAD (Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery).  The anycast
      address is calculated as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 64 bits length prefix, concatinated address of your
      prefix and 0xfdfffffffffffffe is the home agent subnet anycast
      addrss. If your prefix is not 64 bits, fill host part bits from
      curving proper bits from the value
      0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe.  For example, if your prefix
      is 2001:200:1:2::/64, the home agent subnet anycast address is
      2001:200:1:2:fdff:ffff:ffff:fffe.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting MIP6</h2>
    
    <h3>Starting a home agent</h3>

    <p>
      To start a home agent, invoke the following command.
    </p>
    <pre>
mip6control -g
    </pre>
    <p>
    That's all.
    </p>

    <h3>Starting a mobile node</h3>
    
    <p>
      To make a node as a mobile node, you must specify your home
      network prefix.  To do this, invoke the following command.
    </p>
    <pre>
mip6control -H2001:200:1:1:: -P64 
    </pre>
    <p>
      Replace '2001:200:1:1::' with your home prefix.  After prefix
      setting has finished, enable mobile function using
      <samp>-m</samp> option.
    </p>
    <pre>
mip6control -m
    </pre>
    <p>
      To detect movement, a mobile node need to receive Router
      Advertisement packets.  The easy way is to invoke
      <samp>rtsol</samp> command.  You may want to run
      <samp>rtsold</samp> with <samp>-a -m</samp> options to make the
      node detect its location quicklly.
    </p>

    <h2>To Do</h2>
    <p>
      There are many things to do.  Followings are some of them.  The
      detailed items are described in <samp>TODO.mobile-ip6</samp> in
      the top of the KAME directory.
      <ul>
      <li>Authentication of bindings</li>
      <li>Mobile Prefix Solicitation/Advertisement</li>
      <li>Socket API</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
