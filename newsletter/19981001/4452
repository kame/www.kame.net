OK, I found that there are several important things.
At first, did you started "faithd" on your translating router?

When you setup net.inet6.ip6.keepfaith, then IPv6 packets are tossed
up to application layer, but there must be translating daemon who
receives those packets and convert them to IPv4 packets and resend
them. That is faithd. Faithd is similar to inet6d, and invoke other
daemon of translated applications.

So for example, if you would like telnet to be translated, you need to
do following things.

(1) disable telnetd to be invoked from inet6d

  You need to comment out telnet from /usr/local/v6/etc/inet6d.conf.
  Initially there should be following entry for telnet.

telnet stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/v6/libexec/telnetd   telnetd

  You need to comment out the line as following.

#telnet stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/v6/libexec/telnetd   telnetd

  And after that you need to "kill and restart your inet6d"
  or "send HUP signal to your inet6d".

(2) start faithd

   Please start faithd as following.

   /usr/local/v6/sbin/faithd telnet /usr/local/v6/libexec/telnetd telnetd

   Then a faithd to tlanslate telnet will emerge. Several faithd can
   be started for each translating application.


And next point is faith prefix. You didn't show your IPv4 embedded
IPv6 address format in your host's /etc/hosts file. If your IPv6
address has some non-zero prefix for faith translation, then you will
need to setup the prefix by faith command on your translating router.

For example, if your IPv4 embedded IPv6 address is like following, 

3ffe:501:4819:ffff::10.0.0.1

then, the faith prefix is 3ffe:501:4819:ffff::,
So you need to do following on your translating router.

/usr/local/v6/sbin/faith -e -p 3ffe:501:4819:ffff::

by this command, faith prefix is set to 3ffe:501:4819:ffff:: in your
router, and faith function is enabled.  "faith -e" and "sysctl -w
net.inet6.ip6.keepfaith=1" has completely same effect, so if you use
faith command, you don't need to use
"sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.keepfaith=1". The redunduncy is just a result
of historical change and update.


And last point is routing. When you send packets whose destination is
IPv4 embedded IPv6 address, then it must be routed to the translating
router. Most easy way is let the router announce IPv6 default route,
or add IPv6 default route which points to the translating router on
your host.

One typical way to accomplish it is that, let start rtadvd on your
translating router, and execute rtsol command on your host.
For example, if your network configuration is like following,

   +---------------+			   +-------------+
   |your IPv6 host |			   | your trans  |	   your 
   |		   |			   | router	 |	  IPv4 hosts
   +---------------+			   +-------------+
           |de0				ep0  |        | ep1
    -------+---------------------------------+--     -+---------------

You should do following on your router.

 /usr/local/v6/sbin/rtadvd ep0

And after that, you should do following on your host.

 /usr/local/v6/sbin/rtsol de0

Then an default route which points to the router will be installed on
your host, and all IPv6 packets from host will be routed to the router.


By the way, please remind that all of above commands need to be
executed by root user.

Also I recommend you to read manual of faith and faithd.  You will be
able to read them as following.

man -M /usr/local/v6/man faith
man -M /usr/local/v6/man faithd

I wonder that your From address is Sergio.Palumbo@CSELT.IT, which is
different from anna.bergamo@cselt.it. Do each of those account are
read by you?


Good Luck,
