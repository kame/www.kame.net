IPv6 specification clearly states that, in the early stage of IPv6 transition,
an IPv6 host must speak IPv4 as well.
However, one might want to setup IPv6-only subnets,
because of the shortage of IPv4 addresses or pure curiosity<TT>:-)</TT>.
In this case, you will need to configure a IPv4-v6 translating gateway
so that you can access your IPv4 mail servers via POP protocol,
or IPv4 web servers such as <A HREF=http://www.yahoo.com/>yahoo</A>.
<P>

This newsletter tries to describe what kind of technologies are available
with KAME stack, to help communication between IPv6 hosts and IPv4 hosts.

<H2>Taxonomy of IPv4-v6 translators</H2>
There are several kind of IPv4-v6 translators possible.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>IP header translator:</STRONG>
	This technology works in IP layer,
	and replaces IPv4 header by IPv6 header.
	IP header translator is similar to famous (and infamous) NAT,
	Network Address Translator.

<LI><STRONG>TCP relay:</STRONG>
	This technology works in TCP layer, and relays IPv4 TCP connection
	to IPv6 TCP connection, and vice versa, regardless of the
	application protocol used over TCP.
	TCP connection is terimnated at the TCP relaying gateway host.
	This technology is similar to SOCKS.

<LI><STRONG>Application gateway:</STRONG>
	This technology works in application protocol layer (such as HTTP),
	and uses application protocol-specific mechanism. 
</UL>

KAME kit comes with several translation tools.
At this moment KAME kit does not include IPv4-v6 header translation code.
As for TCP relay, we provide <A HREF=ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/kame/misc/>
SOCKS64</A>, an IPv4/v6 capable version of SOCKS5.
As for application gateway, we provide IPv6-capable
<A HREF=http://www.apache.org/>apache</A> web server,
which can be used as http proxy server.
<P>

KAME kit also include (our home-brew) IPv6-to-IPv4 translator called
<STRONG>FAITH</STRONG>.
FAITH can be regarded as an mixture of TCP relay and application gateway
(FAITH translates any TCP connection, however, it has some knowledge of
application protocols such as <TT>ftp</TT>).
In the following section we describe how to configure FAITH translator.

<H2>What FAITH provides</H2>

From here, please assume the following network configuration.
<PRE>
four.kame.net
  |
==+=======+== IPv4 network
	  |
	dual.kame.net
	  |
	==+=======+== IPv6 network
		  |
		six.kame.net
</PRE>
<TT>four.kame.net</TT> is an IPv4-only host, and <TT>six.kame.net</TT>
is an IPv6-only host, as the hostname suggests.
<TT>dual.kame.net</TT> is IPv4-v6 capable router, and on this host
FAITH translator will be executed.
Actually, <TT>dual.kame.net</TT> need not have two network interfaces.
It can perform translation with single interface, as below:
<PRE>
four.kame.net		six.kame.net
  |			  |
==+=======+===============+== IPv4/v6 network
	  |
	dual.kame.net
</PRE>

What FAITH provide is an translation service for connection originating
from IPv6 host (<TT>six.kame.net</TT>) to IPv4 host (<TT>four.kame.net</TT>).
<P>

FAITH reserves an IPv6 prefix from your IPv6 address space.
Suppose this to be <TT>3ffe:0501:9999:ffff::/64</TT>
(NOTE: prefix must be grabbed from the IPv6 address pool assigned to your
organization/laboratory).
If there is an TCP connection request from <TT>six.kame.net</TT> toward
<TT>3ffe:0501:9999:ffff::&lt;IPv4 address of four.kame.net&gt;</TT>,
it will get translated into IPv4 TCP connection toward
<TT>four.kame.net</TT>.
FAITH daemon on <TT>dual.kame.net</TT> will make two TCP connection,
as below, and transfers data between those.
<UL>
<LI>IPv6 TCP connection between <TT>six.kame.net</TT>
	and <TT>3ffe:0501:9999:ffff::&lt;IPv4 address of four.kame.net&gt;</TT>.
	This connection is actually made between <TT>six.kame.net</TT> and
	<TT>dual.kame.net</TT>.
<LI>IPv4 TCP connection between <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>
	and <TT>four.kame.net</TT>.
</UL>

<H2>Configuring FAITH</H2>
Most configurations must be made on <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>.
There will be almost no configuration required on <TT>six.kame.net</TT>.
<OL>
<LI>First and foremost, IPv6 packets from <TT>six.kame.net</TT> must go
	through <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>.
	If not, please configure <TT>six.kame.net</TT> so that it will
	throw packets to <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>.
	You may find <TT>rtadvd</TT>, router advertisement daemon,
	useful for this purpose.

<LI>Confirm that you have no IPv6 network daemon working on
	<TT>dual.kame.net</TT> for the translated port.
	If you are willing to translate IPv6 telnet request into IPv4
	telnet request, you must comment out <TT>telnet</TT> in
	<TT>/usr/local/v6/etc/inet6d.conf</TT>.
	Do not forget to do <TT>kill -HUP &lt;inet6d's pid&gt;</TT>.

<LI>Set FAITH-reserved prefix, by using <TT>faith</TT> command.
<PRE>
# faith -e -p 3ffe:0501:9999:ffff::
</PRE>
	<TT>-e</TT> is for enabling kernel code to help FAITH daemon.
	By this configuration, all the IPv6 TCP toward FAITH-reserved IPv6
	prefix will be tossed up to the application layer.
	To make sure, confirm that <TT>sysctl</TT> MIB
	<TT>net.inet6.ip6.keepfaith</TT> is 1.
	If not, set it to 1 by using <TT>sysctl</TT> command:
<PRE>
# sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.keepfaith=1
</PRE>

<LI>Start <TT>faithd</TT> daemon on <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>.
	To translate <TT>telnet</TT> connection, please invoke:
<PRE>
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/faithd telnet /usr/local/v6/libexec/telnetd telnetd
</PRE>
	<TT>faithd</TT> must be invoked for each of the services you need,
	so you may want to start multiple <TT>faithd</TT>.
	Refer to the manpage of <TT>faithd</TT> for details.

<LI>Try a <TT>telnet</TT> session from <TT>six.kame.net</TT> to
	<TT>3ffe:0501:9999:ffff::&lt;IPv4 address of four.kame.net&gt;</TT>.
	The connection request will be captured by <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>
	since the address matches the FAITH-reserved prefix.
	<TT>faithd</TT> will accept the IPv6 TCP connection, and makes a
	IPv4 TCP connection toward <TT>four.kame.net</TT>.
</OL>

<H2>Advanced configuration</H2>
You will find it irritating to specify
<TT>3ffe:0501:9999:ffff::&lt;IPv4 address of four.kame.net&gt;</TT>
every time you want a translation service.
<P>

For address conversion, there are two major ways to do it.
The first way is to use a home-brew DNS server, called <TT>newbie</TT>,
which is implemented by Yusuke Doi of WIDE project.
It includes the address conversion function.<BR>
The next way is to have an entry in <TT>/etc/hosts</TT>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><TT>newbie</TT> case:</STRONG><BR>
	You can configure <TT>newbie</TT> nameserver on <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>,
	with FAITH-friendly function enabled by the following directive:
<PRE>
faith 3ffe:0501:9999:ffff::
</PRE>
	Then, configure <TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT> in <TT>six.kame.net</TT> to
	use <TT>dual.kame.net</TT> as its nameserver.
<PRE>
nameserver &lt;numeric IPv6 address of dual.kame.net&gt;
</PRE>
<P>

On name queries to IPv4 hosts, <TT>newbie</TT> will return IPv6 address,
<TT>3ffe:0501:9999:ffff::ipv4-address</TT>.
<P>

<LI>Have lines like follows, in <TT>/etc/hosts</TT>.

<PRE>
3ffe:501:9999:ffff::123.4.5.6	mymachine.mydomain.com
</PRE>

</UL>

<H2>Some notice</H2>
By using <TT>FAITH</TT> translator, IPv4 TCP connection will be made
between a host running <TT>faithd</TT> (<TT>dual.kame.net</TT> in the example)
and the target host (<TT>four.kame.net</TT>).
As you can imagine, if a daemon on <TT>four.kame.net</TT> invokes <TT>getpeername()</TT>
system call, it will return <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>, not <TT>six.kame.net</TT>.
Therefore, you may have some trouble logging/authenticating the connection on
<TT>four.kame.net</TT>.
For example, if you use <TT>.rhosts</TT> or <TT>known_hosts</TT> used by <TT>ssh</TT>,
thre may be some strange behavior.
Also, the hostname shown by <TT>wtmp</TT> will be <TT>dual.kame.net</TT>
(not <TT>six.kame.net</TT>).
This is because you are using TCP relay technology.
Every TCP relay or NAT technology has this problem.
There is no good way to avoid this.
