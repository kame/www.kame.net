<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This troubleshooting guide classifies the tips for IPv6 multicast 
troubleshooting into three categories.
<ol>
<li> <a href="#send">Issues in Sending Hosts</a>
<li> <a href="#recv">Issues in Receiving Hosts</a>
<li> <a href="#rtg">Issues in Routing Configuration</a>
</ol>

From my experiance, I often encounters the first two issues.
So please be careful to confirm that they don't exist in your environment,
before going into the analysis of the complex behavior of the PIM protocol.

<h2>1. Possible Issues in Sending Hosts</h2>
</a>
<dl>
<dt>(a) Hoplimit is large enough?
<dd><p>KAME transmits IPv6 multicast packets with hoplimit = 1, unless application explicitly specifies some hoplimit value.  This fact means that IPv6 multicast packets don't go over a router by default due to a lack of hoplimit.</p>

<p>So if you cannot receive packets from a multicast packet sender, please check the hoplimit first!</p>
 
<dt>(b) Packet size is less than 1280?
<dd><p>Some router does not generate ICMPv6 Packet-Too-Big Error for multicast packets, to prevent ICMPv6 Error packet generation for multicast packets (Precisely speaking, it's against ICMPv6 Spec(draft-ietf-ipngwg-icmp-v6-04.txt section 2.4 (e)).  Such systems, however, assumes that multicast senders transmit multicast packets less than 1280 Byte).</p>

<p>If your network has such a router, you should take a great care to see if the size of the transmitted packets shouldn't exceed more than 1280 bytes. </p>

<a name="recv">
<h2>2. Possible Issues in Receiving Hosts</h2>
</a>
<dl>
<dt>(a) Have you joined a multicast group?
<dd> <p>Sometimes people forget to start IPv6 multicast receiver application:-) </p>
<dt>(b) MLD version is correct?
<dd> <p>Especially when there's a MLD snooping switch between a host and its accomodating router, you should take care of the MLD version.</p>
</dl>

<h2>3. Possible Issues in Routing Configuration</h2>
