    <h1>KAME Mobile IPv6 How To</h1>
    <a href="mailto:keiichi@iij.ad.jp">Keiichi SHIMA</a> @ {<a href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME Project</a> | <a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/index-e.html">Internet Initiative Japan</a>}

    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      This documents decsribes the step-by-step instruction to use
      KAME Mobile IPv6(KAME/MIP6) features.  Since KAME/MIP6 is still
      under developping, these information may be outdated at the time
      when you are reading this document (this document targets the
      kame-20020128-*-snap.tgz).  Please refer the latest
      documentation included in the KAME kit in such a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      (NOTE: there is a bug in authentication data processing in
      kame-20020128-*-snap.tgz.  You should get the latest source from
      the cvs repositry if you are using 20020128 snap and have a plan
      to use the authentication data sub-option feature.)
    </p>
      
    <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

    <p>
      Currently, FreeBSD and NetBSD have been checked to work as a
      home agent, a mobile node and a correspondent node.  Other BSDs
      (OpenBSD and BSD/OS) have not been tested yet.
    </p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <p>
      KAME/MIP6 is under developping.  You should use the latest KAME
      snap kit.  The latest is always the best to use.  Get the latest
      snap kit from <a href="http://www.kame.net/">the KAME Project
      website</a> </p>

    <h2>Compile with MIP6 extention</h2>
    
    <p>
      MIP6 is not enabled by default.  You should prepare a new kernel
      configuration file and rebuild your kernel that is able to speak
      the MIP6 protocol.  Also, some user-space commands need
      recompilation.  Follow the instruction below.
    </p>

    <h3>recompile your kernel</h3>

    <p>
      To enable MIP6 features, specify following kernel options in
      your kernel configuration file and recompile the kernel.
    </p>
    <pre>
options MIP6
options MIP6_DEBUG
options MIP6_ALLOW_COA_FALLBACK
# options MIP6_DRAFT13
pseudo-device hif 1
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you specify <samp>MIP6_DEBUG</samp>, the kernel will print
      many debuging messages.  Though it may be annoying you, it is
      very useful when you encounter some problems.  These debug
      messages can be enabled/disabed at run time using the
      <samp>mip6control</samp> program.
    </p>
    <p>
      <samp>MIP6_ALLOW_COA_FALLBACK</samp> enables the CoA fallback
      feature.  In the MIP6 specification, the author decleres that
      all IPv6 node must support the home address destination option.
      But, there are not so many implementations those support the
      option.  If the peer doesn't recognizes the home address
      destination option, the mobile node can't communicate with that
      node.  If you specify <samp>MIP6_ALLOW_COA_FALLBACK</samp>, the
      kernel will try to use its home address as a source address
      <em>WITHOUT</em> the home address destination option.  If this
      approach fails, the kernel will use CoA as its source address in
      the next time to connect to the same peer.  Yes, I know that the
      former violates MIP6 specification and the latter prevents the
      mobile node from moving from one network to another network,
      though, it is very useful in such a transision period that not
      all implementations support the home address destination option.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to use MIP6 which is compliant to
      draft-ietf-mobileip-ipv6-13, <samp>MIP6_DRAFT13</samp> enables
      this.  Note that, we are usually concentrated to the latest
      draft.  The backward compatibility is not promised to be
      available forever.  The rest of this document is for users who
      are using draft-ietf-mobileip-ipv6-15, not 13.
    </p>

    <h3>Build user space commands</h3>

    <p>
      There are three user-space commands related to MIP6.  One is
      <samp>rtadvd</samp> and the next is <samp>mip6control</samp> and
      the last is <samp>had</samp>.  If you want to have a home agent,
      you must rebuild <samp>rtadvd</samp> with <samp>MIP6</samp>
      option and build <samp>had</samp>.  <samp>mip6control</samp> is
      a controll command of KAME/MIP6 functions.  All users need to
      build <samp>mip6control</samp> to use KAME/MIP6.
    </p>

    <h4>recompile <samp>rtadvd</samp></h4>
    
    <p>
      Go to the directory of <samp>rtadvd</samp>
      (<samp>${KAME}/freebsd4/sbin/rtadvd/</samp> for FreeBSD), add
      the following line to <samp>Makefile</samp>
    </p>
    <pre>
CFLAGS+=-DMIP6
    </pre>
    Recompile <samp>rtadvd</samp> and install it.
    <pre>
$ make clean
$ make
$ su (become the super user)
# make install
    </pre>

    <h4>build <samp>had</samp></h4>

    <p>
      Currently, <samp>had</samp> is not automatically
      built/installed.  Go to <samp>${KAME}/kame/kame/had/</samp> and
      make it.
    </p>
    <pre>
$ make
$ su (become the super user)
# make install
    </pre>

    <h4>build <samp>mip6control</samp></h4>

    <p>
      If you are using other operating system than FreeBSD, go to
      <samp>${KAME}/kame/kame/mip6control/</samp> and just make.
    </p>
    <pre>
$ make
$ su (become the super user)
# make install
    </pre>
    <p>
      The latest KAME/FreeBSD4 will automatically compile
      <samp>mip6control</samp> and install it to the proper directory.
    </p>

    <h2>Set up a home agent</h2>

    <p>
      To become a home agent, complete the following settings.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>home agent subnet anycast address</li>
      <li>prepare <samp>rtadvd.conf</samp> for a home agent</li>
      <li>invoke <samp>rtadvd</samp> with <samp>-m</samp> flag
      <li>invoke <samp>had</samp>
    </ul>

    <h3>Assign home agent subnet anycast address</h3>

    <p>
      Assigning a home agent subnet anycast address makes it possible
      to do DHAAD (Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery).  The anycast
      address is calculated as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 64 bits length prefix, concatinated address of your
      prefix and 0xfdfffffffffffffe is the home agent subnet anycast
      addrss. If your prefix is not 64 bits, fill host part bits from
      curving proper bits from the value
      0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe.  For example, if your prefix
      is 2001:200:1:2::/64, the home agent subnet anycast address is
      2001:200:1:2:fdff:ffff:ffff:fffe.
    </p>
    <pre>
# ifconfig fxp0 inet6 2001:200:1:2:fdff:ffff:ffff:fffe anycast alias
    </pre>
    <p>
      This address must be configured before <samp>had</samp> is
      invoked.
    </p>

    <h3>Prepare <samp>rtadvd.conf</samp> for a home agent</h3>

    <p>
      Here is the example of the <samp>rtadvd.conf</samp>.
    </p>
    <pre>
fxp0:\
        :maxinterval#60:mininterval#40:
    </pre>
    <p>
      When <samp>rtadvd</samp> is invoked with <samp>-m</samp> switch,
      it will automatically generate the proper router advertisement
      for mobile use.  Basically, you need not to prepare
      <samp>rtadvd.conf</samp>.  The above example is for users who
      want to change the advertising interval from the default value.
    </p>

    <h3>Invoke <samp>rtadvd</samp></h3>
    
    <p>
      Invoke <samp>rtadvd</samp> with <samp>-m</samp> option.  This
      option enables MIP6 feature of rtadvd.  For example, if you have
      a fxp0 interface,
    </p>
    <pre>
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/rtadvd -m fxp0
    </pre>

    <h3>Invoke <samp>had</samp></h3>

    <p>
      Invoke <samp>had</samp> with the interface name that you want to
      enable the DHAAD on.  Without <samp>had</samp> the DHAAD feature
      will not work.
    </p>
    <pre>
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/had fxp0
    </pre>

    <h2>Starting MIP6</h2>
    
    <h3>Starting a home agent</h3>

    <p>
      To start a home agent, invoke the following command.  Of course,
      you must have finished the setting of the anycast address and
      daemons described above.
    </p>
    <pre>
# mip6control -g
    </pre>
    <p>
    That's all.
    </p>

    <h3>Starting a mobile node</h3>
    
    <p>
      To make a node as a mobile node, you must specify your home
      network prefix.  To do this, invoke the following command.
    </p>
    <pre>
# mip6control -H2001:200:1:1:: -P64 
    </pre>
    <p>
      Replace '2001:200:1:1::' with your home prefix.  After prefix
      setting has finished, enable mobile function using
      <samp>-m</samp> option.
    </p>
    <pre>
# mip6control -m
    </pre>
    <p>
      To detect movement, a mobile node need to receive Router
      Advertisement packets.  The easy way is to invoke
      <samp>rtsol</samp> command.  You may want to run
      <samp>rtsold</samp> with <samp>-a -m</samp> options to make the
      node detect its location quicklly.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting up the security features</h2>

    <p>
      The KAME/MIP6 can protect the binding update/binding ack using a
      security mechanism.  By defalt, the KAME/MIP6 uses the
      authentication sub-option defined in the
      draft-ietf-mobileip-ipv6-15 to protect them.  To protect them,
      you must set up the security associations between the nodes.
      Currently the KAME/MIP6 re-use the security association database
      for the IPsec stack of the KAME.  So, you need to use
      <samp>setkey</samp> program to set up the security associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you want to protect the binding update/ack
      between the mobile node which address is A and the home agent
      which address is B, set up the security association described
      bellow:
    </p>
    <pre>
add A B ah 1500 -m transport -A hmac-sha1 "AH SA configuration!";
add B A ah 1600 -m transport -A hmac-sha1 "AH SA configuration!";
    </pre>
    <p>
      Also, you must set up the security policy as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
spdadd ::/0[any] ::/0[any] ipv6-opts -P out ipsec ah/transport//require;
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you don't want to protect them, you can disable this feature
      using <samp>mip6control</samp> program.  To disable the
      authentication data protection, type the following:
    </p>
    <pre>
# mip6control -T 0
    </pre>

    <h2>To Do</h2>
    <p>
      There are many things to do.  Followings are some of them.  The
      detailed items are described in <samp>TODO.mobile-ip6</samp> in
      the top of the KAME directory.
      <ul>
      <li>Mobile Prefix Solicitation/Advertisement</li>
      <li>Socket API</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
