(1) SSM

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/APPLE-SSM.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  done

IPR claim overview:
  Once SSM becomes standard:

    "licenses will be available to any party on reasonable,
    nondiscriminatory terms, on condition of reciprocity and defensive
    use, for a compliant implementation of the protocol."

Concern:
  It is unclear for us who should make a contract with Apple.  The IPR
  claim says, Apple will issue a license to "a compliant
  implementation of the protocol".  What does "a compliant
  implementation of the protocol" exactly mean?  Does it mean the code
  distributed from KAME project?  Or does it mean all implementations
  which use KAME SSM code?  Or does it mean all users who are using
  KAME SSM code?

Request:
  Making a contract is a barrier for the deployment of SSM.  We
  request the IPR claim which doesn't need any contract of a license.

Importance: urgent
  This is a big problem, since SSM is supposed to be almost mandatory
  for the deployment of IPv4/IPv6 multicasting.  Especially in IPv6,
  it is much easier to deploy SSM keeping pace with the deployment of
  IPv6.  Otherwise, we have to deploy SSM after IPv6 is widely
  deployed, which seems tough task to replace existing all IPv6 nodes
  with SSM capable nodes.

(2) MODP

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/certicom-ipr-rfc3526-rfc2409-ikev2.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  done

Concern:
  - It seems this IPR claim affects all applications which use MODP.
    IKE/IKEv2, which are standard key exchange protocols used in
    IPsec, also is affected, if it is true.
  - What does "Certicom will provide a nonexclusive, royalty-free
    patent license, with reasonable terms and conditions" exactly
    mean?  Who should make a contract?

Request:
  - We request them to provide MODP group1 and group2, which are used
    in IKE/IKEv2, with no license.
  - A key exchange mechanism is necessary to deploy IPsec.  Posing
    contract of a license to use key exchange mechanisms will make a
    hurdle for IPsec deployment.

Importance: urgent
  It is a big problem, since there is no other replacement for
  IKE/IKEv2 for now.

(3) NEMO

URL:
  Cisco:
    http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/cisco-ipr-draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support.txt
  Nokia:
    http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/nokia-ipr-draft-ietf-nemo-basic-support.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  - not implemented
    (c.f.)Nautilus6 project has a NEMO implementation based on KAME
          (code is not released)

IPR overview:
  Cisco:
    - NEMO users must make a contract with Cisco, if the patent
      submitted by Cisco related to NEMO covers NEMO technology we are
      going to use.  (The patent is not published yet, BTW)
    - The license is provided "under reasonable, non-discriminatory
      terms"
  Nokia:
    - NEMO implementors who are using technologies covered by the
      Nokia patents (US10/295014、WO03/043226) must use
      GPL(http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html) or open source license
      (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html).

Concern:
  Cisco:
    - Assume that KAME implements NEMO and the NEMO technology is
      covered by the Cisco patent, who should make a contract with
      Cisco?  Only KAME project?  Or all KAME code integrators (such
      as BSD development team)?  Or all users which use KAME derives
      NEMO code?
    - What does "under reasonable, non-discriminatory terms" exactly
      mean?
  Nokia:
    - BSD license is listed as one of compatible licenses with open
      source license.  However the IPR claim is unclear that BSD
      license is acceptable in this particular case.
    - Assume that BSD license is acceptable by Nokia, how about KAME
      license?

Request:
  Cisco:
    - We request IPR claim which doesn't require any contract of a
      license.
  Nokia:
    - We request Nokia to accept KAME license to distribute NEMO
      technologies, if the technologies are covered by their patents.

Importance: urgent
  Deployment of network mobility is a key aspect of deployment of the
  whole mobility technologies.  We strongly want to distribute NEMO
  implementation to accelerate deployment of mobility.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) IKEv2

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/microsoft-ipr-draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  ongoing

Concern:
  - Microsoft says they have patents with regard to IKEv2.  However it
    is unclear which part of the specification is covered by their
    patents.
  - Posing contract of a license ("Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory
    License to All Implementers with Possible Royalty/Fee") will make
    a hurdle for deployment of IKEv2.

Request:
  - We at least need clarification which part is affected by their
    patents

Importance: urgent
  We don't have alternative key exchange mechanism other than IKE/IKEv2.
  It is very important for us to deploy IKE/IKEv2.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) ISATAP

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/sri-ipr-draft-ietf-ngtrans-isatap.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  done.  However, the code has been removed.

Concern:
  - What does "Royalty-Free, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory License
    to All Implementers" exactly mean?
    * Who should make a contract?  Only KAME?  Or implementors who use
      KAME derived codes (e.g. FreeBSD)?
    * The licensing terms requested by SRI is unknown.  We cannot
      check if the license is compatible with our license.
  - We got no reply from Peter Marcotullio(the contact person of this IPR)
  - Fred Templin(the author of the patent and ISATAP specification)
    said, he can do nothing because this patent was submitted before he
    changed his company.

Importance: important
  ISATAP is tend to be used as a transition mechanism especially in
  enterprise networks.  KAME project received questions frequently,
  why did we removed the technology.  We want to provide ISATAP as one
  of transition mechanisms.

Note: The same discussion can be applied to Teredo.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) VRRP

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/NAT-VRRP-IBM
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/VRRP-CISCO
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/cisco-ipr-draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv6-spec.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  done.  However, the code has been removed.

Concern:
  The validity of the IPR claim
    The patent which is referred by this IPR claim is for HSRP, not
    for VRRP.  Can it be applied to VRRP also?  One
    expert(mcbride@openbsd.org) mentioned that VRRP is not affected by
    the HSRP patents.

Request:
  - Posing contract of a license will be a hurdle for deployment of
    VRRP.  We need a royalty free license which doesn't require any
    contract.

Importance: normal
  We don't have any urgent needs to distribute VRRP for IPv6 for now.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) SEND IPR:

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/ericsson-send-ipsec.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/microsoft-ipr-draft-ietf-send-cga.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/microsoft-ipr-draft-ietf-send-ipsec.txt

Implementation status in KAME:
  not yet
  (note: we received a request from the chair of SEND
  WG(kempf@docomolabs.com) to implement SEND)

IPR claim overview:
  SEND plan to use CGA technology.
  - Ericsson says, everyone can use their patent as long as he doesn't
    attack Ericsson by his patent.
  - Microsoft says, implementers must get a license from Microsoft.

Concern:
  (Ericsson) KAME will not provide any code which has some conditions
    to distribute.  In this case, "as long as he doesn't attack
    Ericsson..." doesn't match KAME IPR policy.
  (Common) It is unclear who should make a contract.  That is, who is
    "a compliant implementation of the protocol"?  Is it OK if KAME
    project make a contract?  Or do they need all KAME derived code
    (e.g. *BSD) to make contracts with them?  Or all *BSD users should
    make contracts with them?
  Posing contract of a license will be a hurdle for deployment of
  SEND.  We need a royalty free license which doesn't require any
  contract.

Importance: not urgent
  We are not sure SEND is a correct way.  We will follow the IETF
  discussion of SEND.

(8) NAT-T/UDP-ENCAP

URL:
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/MICROSOFT-NAT-Traversal.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/CISCO-mobileip-nat-traversal.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/MICROSOFT-NAT-Traversal.txt
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/SSH-HUTTUNEN-IPSEC-ESP-IN-UDP
  http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/SSH-NAT

Implementation status in KAME:
  not yet

Concern:
  We need NAT-T and UDP-ENCAP technologies to use IPsec over NAT.
  These technologies are de-facto standard now.  However, three
  companies (Microsoft, Cisco, SSH) claims they have patents for these
  technologies.  With which company should we make a contract?

Importance: not urgent
  Not all users use this technologies.  There is no urgency.
