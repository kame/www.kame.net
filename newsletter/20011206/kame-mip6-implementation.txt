DRAFT                KAME Mobile IPv6 Implementation        Dec. 7, 2001


1.  Overview

   KAME/MIP6 is based on the three implementations (Ericsson, NEC, Keio
   Univ.) those have been built on the KAME IPv6 protocol stack before.
   We are trying to utilize the merits of those implementations and
   provide one concrete MIP6 stack for the KAME IPv6 stack.

   The KAME/MIP6 supports CN, HA and MN functions.  The base
   specification is the current one.  At this point, the specification
   is draft-ietf-mobileip-ipv6-15.txt.


2.  KAME/MIP6 implementation note



2.1.  Subnet in KAME/MIP6

   MIP6 is designed for the node that is moving from one subnet to
   another subnet without closing existing connections.  When the node
   moves from one subnet to other subnet, we think the node has moved.
   MIP6 spec doesn't define the notation of subnet.  KAME/MIP6 defines
   the word subnet as 'the group of prefixes and routers those have some
   relationships with each other'.  See the following example.


   Router R1 announcing Prefix P1, Prefix P2
   Router R2 announcing Prefix P3, Prefix P4
   Router R3 announcing Prefix P1, Prefix P5
   Router R4 announcing Prefix P4, Prefix P6
   Router R5 announcing Prefix P7


   In this case, we have 5 routers (R1...R5) and 7 prefixes (P1...P7).
   By our definition of subnet, we can group them into 3 subnets.


   Subnet S1 (Router R1, R3) (Prefix P1, P2, P4)
   Subnet S2 (Router R2, R4) (Prefix P3, P4, P6)
   Subnet S3 (Router R5) (Prefix P7)


   Router R1 and R3 are in the same subnet because those routers share
   the prefix P1.  Similarly, Router R2 and R4 are the same subnet.
   Router R5 is only router in the subnet S3 because it doesn't share
   any information with other router.  KAME/MIP6 treats these 3 subnet

   as different ones, even if they are physically on the same wire.


2.2.  CoA selection in KAME/MIP6

   The KAME/MIP6 stack re-selects the CoA when the states of prefixes
   have changed.  The KAME IPv6 stack maintain all the received
   prefixes.  The point is that the KAME stack has one more additional
   state information of the prefix than the specification defines.  The
   stateless address auto-configuration specification defines some
   states of IPv6 addresses.  In this paper, we focus two states, one is
   PREFERRED and the other is DEPRECATED.  These states are derived from
   the prefix states.  If the prefix has the preferred lifetime left,
   the address derived from the prefix is also PREFERRED.  If the prefix
   has only the valid lifetime left and the preferred lifetime expired,
   the address is DEPRECATED.  In addition to those states, the KAME
   IPv6 stack has a DETACHED address state.  If the prefix has the valid
   lifetime left but the advertising router of the prefix seems
   unreachable, the prefix is marked as detached.  The address derived
   from the detached prefix is also marked as DETACHED.  Following are
   the algorithm of KAME/MIP6 CoA selection.

   1. find addresses those are not ANYCAST, DUPLICATED, DEPRECATED and
   DETACHED.

   2. if the previous CoA is one of addresses found during the procedure
   1, continue using the same address as the CoA.

   3. if the previous CoA is not found, select one address from
   addresses found during the procedure 1.

   Current implementation pick the last found address as a new CoA.  We
   can introduce some policy based address selection mechanism in the
   selection procedure.  For example, we may want to mark the Ethernet
   interfaces as perferrable than the cellular interfaces.

   This CoA selection algorithm is the key of the movement detection
   algorithm of the KAME/MIP6.  The movement detection is described in
   the next section.


2.2.1.  Comment about the spec

   We have no mechanism to invalidate the old prefix.  'Old' means, it
   has preferred lifetime left but, no advertising router on the current
   subnet.  This happens when we change the network.  We have no way to
   determine if we can use the old (in KAME sense, detached) address.

   Should the autoconf spec note about this?


2.3.  Movement detaction in KAME/MIP6

   While many implementations check advertised prefixes and default
   router change to detect the node movement, KAME/MIP6 only checks the
   change of its CoA.  As already described, KAME/MIP6 CoA re-selection
   is done whenever the states of prefixes change.  Therefore, the
   change of the CoA in our implementation means the old prefix of the
   old CoA is no longer usable.  It is not important whether the node
   moves from one wire to another wire.  The point is the node always
   selects its CoA based on the states of the current usable prefixes
   and routers those are advertising prefixes. Once the CoA has changed,
   we must update binding regardless of moving from one real wire to
   another.

   When KAME/MIP6 detects movement (this means that KAME/MIP6 detects
   CoA change), KAME/MIP6 start movement processing.  For example,
   sending binding updates to each destination node of binding update
   list.


2.4.  One more note about CoA selection

   Our algorithm may detect wrong location in the following case.

       ----+--------                   ----+-------
           |                               |
         +-+--+                          +-+--+
         | R1 |                          | R2 |
         +-+--+ Prefix P1                +-+--+ Prefix P2
           |                               |
       ----+---------------+---------------+---- home wire
                           |
                         +----+ home prefix == P1
                         | MN |
                         +----+

   There are two routers (R1, R2) in the home wire.  Router R1 announces
   Prefix P1 and R2 announces P2.  By definition of our subnet, there
   are two subnets on the wire.

   Subnet S1 (Router R1) (Prefix P1)
   Subnet S2 (Router R2) (Prefix P2)

   Under this condition, if we specify only one prefix as a home prefix,
   we can't determine whether we are home or not.  In this network, both



draft-keiichi-mobileip-kame-implementation-00.txt               [Page 5]

DRAFT                KAME Mobile IPv6 Implementation        Dec. 7, 2001


   P1 and P2 are valid.  We can use both addresses derived from each
   prefix.

   Now, assume we select P1 as a home prefix.  If we select CoA derived
   from P2, we determine that we are on the foreign network.  But in
   fact, we are home too.  MN will start configuring addresses and get
   two addresses.  One is from P1 and the other is from P2.  Next, MN
   sends a binding update to make a home registration but it fails
   because HA fails DAD for the MN home address.  In this case, MN
   should determine that it is home.

   This problem can be easily avoided by preferring the home address in
   selecting a new CoA.  (Not implemented yet.)

   (Current implementation have bugs in handing this situation, so, this
   doesn't work with such a network described above.)


2.5.  Router Identifier

   As many folks have said already, our implementation also have a
   router identifier problem.  If different two routers have same link-
   local address, we think those two routers are the same router.  This
   problem can be avoided by using router global address.  But, since
   the global address is included in the prefix infomation option of the
   router advertisement, we must process the prefix information option
   twice.  First time for finding a global address, second time for
   grouping received prefixes into subnet groups (and also, ordinally
   prefix information option processing).


2.5.1.  Comment about the spec

   Do we need another identifier other than the link-local address ?


2.6.  The wrong source address in the ICMP error payload

   In our implementation, the home address and the CoA is exchanged in
   the destination options header processing routine.  If we encounter
   some errors after this point, it produces the ICMP error packet with
   a payload that include the original IPv6 packet with a wrong
   (excnanged) source address.  To avoid this problem, we consider two
   different mechanisms.  One is to recover a correct source address at
   all the points the process are needed.  The other is not to exchange
   the home address and the CoA in the destination options header
   processing and remain the CoA in a IPv6 source address field.  We
   implemented both mechanisms and decided to adopt the former.  In the



draft-keiichi-mobileip-kame-implementation-00.txt               [Page 6]

DRAFT                KAME Mobile IPv6 Implementation        Dec. 7, 2001


   former mechanism, the point to recover the original source address is
   only the function which generates ICMP error packet.  Other parts of
   the code seems to have no need to restore the source address.  While,
   the latter mechanism requires tens to a hundred code fixes those
   refer the IPv6 source address field.


2.6.1.  Comments

   We select the former mechanism because it require only a small fix of
   the existing code.  But we should reconsider if the former mechanism
   is better than the latter mechanism later.  It is natural to keep the
   IPv6 packet not modified.  If we meet some other situations like
   ICMP6 error in the future, we must make a code that recover the
   original source address again as we have done in the current
   icmp6error routine.  Is it really ad-hoc isn't it?


2.7.  Security mechanism is not implemented yet

   We plan to implement some weak authentication mechanisms.  Currently
   we are investigating which one is the best.
