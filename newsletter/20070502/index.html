  <h1>KAME project's action on Type 0 Routing Header issue</h1>

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>
    At the CanSecWest2007, a report titled `Fun with IPv6 routing
    headers' was presented indicating that the IPv6 Type 0 Routing
    Header can be used as an attacking method.
    One of the described attacks can exploit any two IPv6 nodes that
    handles the Type 0 Routing Header as described in RFC2460,
    including the KAME/BSD based nodes, to consume the bandwidth
    between those two nodes.
    Although the presentation slides on this type of attack have some
    technical errors, the main threat still seems to exist.
  </p>

  <h2>KAME Project's Action</h2>

  <p>
    The KAME project performed the following actions to fix the issue
    and to prevent the issue from being used as a method of attacks.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixed the KAME source code to disable the Type 0 Routing
      Header.  The <samp>ip6_rthdr0()</samp> function was commented out
      and the incoming Type 0 Routing Header is now processed as an
      unknown Routing Header.<br />
      <a href="rthdr0.diff.txt">The proper diff can be found here.</a><br />
      You can also browse the changelog on cvsweb at here:
      <a href="http://www.kame.net/dev/cvsweb2.cgi/kame/kame/sys/netinet6/route6.c"><tt>route6.c</tt></a>,
      <a href="http://www.kame.net/dev/cvsweb2.cgi/kame/kame/sys/netinet6/in6_proto.c"><tt>in6_proto.c</tt></a> and
      <a href="http://www.kame.net/dev/cvsweb2.cgi/kame/kame/sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c"><tt>ip6_input.c</tt></a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Announced the fix to the maintainers of the BSD variants as
      well as vendors that have incorporated the KAME/BSD IPv6 stack
      into their products.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discussed how to deal with this issue spec-wise at the IETF (ongoing).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recommendation</h2>
  <p>
    There is no need to panic, but it is strongly recommended to apply
    the above change (see also the security advisory from BSDs below)
    and reboot the kernel, especially for those IPv6 nodes that are
    widely known and attached to a high-bandwidth link.
