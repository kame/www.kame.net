  <h1>KAME projet action on Type 0 Routing Header issue</h1>

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>At the CanSecWest2007, a report titled `Fun with IPv6 routing
    headers' was presented indicating that the IPv6 Type 0 Routing
    Header can be used as an attacking method same as the source
    routing option of IPv4.
  </p>

  <h2>KAME project action</h2>

  <p>The KAME project performed the following actions to fix the issue
    and to prevent the issue from being used as a method of attack.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixed the KAME source code to disable the Type 0 Routing
      Header.  The <samp>ip6_rthdr0()</samp> function is commented out
      and the incoming Type 0 Routing Header is processed as an
      unknown Routing Header.
    </li>
    <li>Announced the fix to the <samp>merge@kame.net</samp> in which
      many IPv6 stack vendors who use the KAME stack (or a part of the
      KAME stack) are subscribed, to notify the decision of the KAME
      project.
    </li>
    <li>Advertised the issue to other stack vendors using various
    communication metods.
    </li>
  </ul>
