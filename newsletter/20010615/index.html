Here are a set of questions we would like to ask to router vendors,
when we make purchase decisions <TT>:-)</TT>

<UL>
<LI>which interface types do you support IPv6?  ether, p2p (BRI/PRI/OC48/...), dialup, 802.1Q VLAN, ...
<LI>SNMP IPv6 transport?  IPv6 MIBs?
<LI>ssh/telnet IPv6 support, incoming/outgoung
<LI>ipv6 forwading performance: normal case (fast path), and with routing header case (slow path).
<LI>any negative impact on IPv4 performance, if we have IPv6 traffic?  or, when we configure IPv6?
<LI>do we have a good orthogonal user-interface for ipv4 and ipv6?
  some vendor routers do like this:
<PRE>
	show ip bgp summary
	show bgp ipv6 summary
</PRE>
  and is confusing.
<LI>can we establish BGP peering over IPv6 link-local address?  what happens if we have multiple interfaces?
<LI>can we configure multiple link-local addresses to a single i/f?
<LI>can we configure multiple address from the same prefix, onto a single i/f:  like P::a and P::b to the same interface?
<LI>can we configure lifetimes on RA messages?  what is the default value? (the value suggested on RFC, or what?)  validation against RAs from other routers?
<LI>acl?  filters?  performance drawbacks if we configure filters?
<LI>router renumbering support?
<LI>memory footprint growth?
<LI>stability?
<LI>support?  no support, special contacts, or normal support contact?
<LI>when do you going to support IPv6 by default?  do we need a special firmware for IPv6, or is IPv6 integrated to normal firmware?
<LI>can we operate routers IPv6-only?  can we disable IPv4?
<LI>performance with tunnels?
<LI>support for ping6 -w (ICMPv6 node information query)?
<LI>DNS over IPv6?
<LI>DNS record types?  (AAAA is fine for us)
<LI>multicast routing?  which multicast routing protocols?
<LI>can we use the box as site border router?  can we support multiple site routing domains?
<LI>which IGPs do you support?  RIPng, ISIS, OSPFv3?  (OSPFv3 is important for many Japanese networks)
<LI>tftp over IPv6?
<LI>how can we disambiguate linklocal peers on multiple different interfaces?
<LI>which kind of tunnelling encapsulations?  static configured tunnel, 6to4, auto-tunnel? (no need for auto-tunnel)
<LI># of IPv6 routes you expect to take?
<LI># of IPv4 routes you expect to take, when IPv6 is enabled?
<LI>(ether switch/wireless basestation) MLD snooping for multicast flooding optmization
<LI>(ether switch/wireless basestation) per-port filtering for router advertisements, to prevent malicious routers from showing up
<LI>have you carefully check the procurement specification by JGN (Japan Gigabit Network)?  it should be useful for you.
