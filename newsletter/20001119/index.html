<h2>
Abstract
</h2>
This document describes how to configure to establish IPsec-SA automatically
on KAME stack.
<br>
To understand configuration for several environment requires the reader
to be familiar with IPsec architecture.
Because many items must be specified in order to establish IPsec-SA
automatically.
This document gives priority to run racoon,
by giving simple example of the environment,
and by putting configuration items to a minimum.
<br>
The reader may required to know about IPsec architecture,
but may not familiar with it.
<p>
Note that this document refers to racoon included in
<tt>kame-20001113-*-snap</tt> or later.
The kits before 20001113 are not suitable to them.

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
If you want IPsec to communicate with somebody, It is required to establish
the Security Association(IPsec-SA) between you and the peer before that.
There are two way to establish it.
One is by using manual configuration.
Another way is automated configuration.
In our implementation, we have a daemon named "racoon" for latter case.
<p>
Several parameters(Key) must be exchanged between you and peer
in order to establish the IPsec-SA.
Racoon exchange them by using IKE.
IKE establish own SA by myself while exchanging Key, don't use IPsec-SA.
There are two phase in IKE.
One is the phase to establish SA for own communication (IKE-SA).
Another is the phase to establish IPsec-SA.
I say Phase 1 and Phase 2 respectively.
The initiator to begin IKE proposes multiple parameters to the responder,
and the responder choices one of them or rejects them in each phases.
Also racoon has some parameter for the management of exchanging.
So that there are many items to configure racoon.
<br>
It is not easy for public users to understand all of them.
This document explains how to configure racoon briefly.
The complex configuration is not described.
Also to use certificate is out of scope in this document.

<h2>
Basic mechanism
</h2>

Kernel maintains two database to use IPsec.
One is the Security Policy Database(SPD).
Kernel refers to SPD in order to decide whether to apply IPsec
to a packet or not.
Also SPD entries specify which/how IPsec-SA is applied.

Another one is the Security Association Database(SAD).
SAD entries contain Key of each IPsec-SA.

<p>
The following figure specifies a flow
until kernel applies IPsec-SA to a packet.

<pre>
	 setkey                racoon  <-------(IKE)-------> somebody
	   |                    ^  |      (5)
	   |                    |  |(6)
	   |(1)           +-----+  +---+
	   |           (4)|            |
	   v              |            v
	+-----+  (2)      |    (3)  +-----+
	| SPD |<----- kernel ------>| SAD |
	+-----+         |           +-----+
                        |(7)
                        v
</pre>

<p>
(1)The administrator sets a policy to SPD by using setkey.<br>
(2)Kernel refers to SPD in order to make a decision of applying IPsec to a packet.<br>
(3)If IPsec is required, then kernel get the Key for IPsec-SA from SAD.<br>
(4)If it is failed, then kernel send a request to get the Key to racoon.<br>
(5)racoon exchange the Key by using IKE with the other to be established IPsec-SA.<br>
(6)racoon put the Key into SAD.<br>
(7)Kernel can send a packet applied IPsec.<br>

<p>
So that the administrator must configure SPD entries by using setkey command,
and must configure racoon.
Also it must be required to run racoon or else on the other side.

<h2>
Starting racoon
</h2>

It is required root privilege to start racoon.
Because racoon use a port 500 of UDP,
also open /var/log/racoon.log as log file.
<br>
Racoon has a few options.  This section explains only typical options.

<dl>
<dt>-<b>f</b> <i>configfile</i>
<dd>Specify alternate configuration file.
<dd><tt>/usr/local/v6/etc/racoon.conf</tt> as default.

<dt>-<b>l</b> <i>logfile</i>
<dd>Specify alternate log file.
<dd><tt>/var/log/racoon.log</tt> as default.

<dt>-<b>d</b> <i>dlevel</i>
<dd>Set debugging level of hexadecimal.
<dd>As below, racoon outputs many information onto standard output and log file.
<pre>
	# racoon -d 0xffffffff
</pre>
</dl>

<h2>
Simple Configuration Sample of Racoon
</h2>

The following description is the one of most simple configuration.
This section explains this sample step by step.

<pre>
	# cat case1.conf
	<b>path pre_shared_key</b> "/usr/local/v6/etc/psk.txt" ;

	<b>remote</b> anonymous
	{
		<b>exchange_mode</b> aggressive ;
		<b>my_identifier user_fqdn</b> "sakane@kame.net" ;
		<b>lifetime</b> time 24 hour ;
		<b>proposal</b> {
			<b>encryption_algorithm</b> 3des;
			<b>hash_algorithm</b> sha1;
			<b>authentication_method</b> pre_shared_key ;
			<b>dh_group</b> 2 ;
		}
	}

	<b>sainfo</b> anonymous
	{
		<b>pfs_group</b> 2;
		<b>lifetime time</b> 12 hour ;
		<b>lifetime byte</b> 50 MB ;
		<b>encryption_algorithm</b> 3des, blowfish, des, rijndael ;
		<b>authentication_algorithm</b> hmac_sha1, hmac_md5 ;
		<b>compression_algorithm</b> deflate ;
	}
</pre>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>path pre_shared_key</b> directive specifies the file which is defined pre-shared keys.  This is used to authenticate the peer on phase 1.
If you don't use the pre-shared key authentication method,
you don't need to define it.  The format is like hosts(4).
Namely they are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.
In the case of the above sample,
the pre-shared key is defined like the following;
<pre>
	sakane@kame.net	secretkey
</pre>

<li><b>my_identifier</b> specifies own identifier
which is used the authentication in phase 1.
The next word "user_fqdn" means to use a User FQDN as own identifier.
this document does not describe the way.
You can use other types, but this document does not describe the way.
</ul>

<h3>remote directive</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>remote</tt></b> directive specifies about Phase 1.
anonymous means to match any peer.
You can limit the exchange to each peer, but the document does not describes it.

<li><b><tt>exchange_mode</tt></b> directive specifies
the exchange mode on Phase 1 <i>aggressive</i> means to exchange
by aggressive mode.
You can use <i>main</i> as main mode and <i>base</i> as base mode.
If a peer start to exchange by the mode which is not specified here,
racoon will reject it.
Although racoon can accept three mode, this document does not describe this way.

<li><b><tt>identifier</tt></b> directive in <b><tt>remote</tt></b> specifies
what own identifier is used.
The identifier will send to the peer, and the peer will use as one of the information of authentication.
In the case of above sample, <b><tt>identifier</tt></b>
in <b><tt>remote</tt></b> is <i>user_fqdn</i>,
so "sakane@kame.net" defined in <b><tt>identifier user_fqdn</tt></b> is applied.

<li><b><tt>lifetime time</tt></b> and <b><tt>lifetime byte</tt></b>
specify the lifetime of IKE-SA.  These are by time and by bytes respectively.
You can use <i>sec</i>, <i>min</i> and <i>hour</i> as the unit of lifetime by time.
And you can use <i>B</i>, <i>KB</i>, <i>MB</i> and <i>TB</i> as the unit of lifetime by bytes.

<li><b><tt>proposal</tt></b> directive specifies a proposal on Phase 1.
Although you can specify multiple proposals, this is the out of scope in this document.

<li><b><tt>encryption_algorithm</tt></b> directive specifies
encryption algorithm on Phase 1.
racoon can use DES, 3DES, RC5, IDEA, CAST, BLOWFISH as encryption algorithm.
You must specify <i>des</i>, <i>3des</i>, <i>rc5</i>, <i>idea</i>, <i>cast</i>, <i>blowfish</i> respectively.
You can specify one of them in a proposal for Phase 1.

<li><b><tt>hash_algorithm</tt></b> directive specifies hash algorithm.
racoon can use MD5 and SHA1 as hash algorithm.
You must specify <i>md5</i> and <i>sha1</i> respectively.
You can specify one of them in a proposal for Phase 1.

<li><b><tt>authentication_method</tt></b> directive specifies
the authentication method on Phase 1.  In the case of above sample,
it means to use Pre-shared Key as authentication method.
Racoon can use RSA Signature authentication method,
but this is the out of scope in this document.

<li><b><tt>dh_group</tt></b> directive specifies a group for
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.  Racoon can use 1, 2 and 5 as this group.
You must specify <i>1</i>, <i>2</i> and <i>5</i> respectively.
</ul>

<h3>sainfo directive</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>sainfo</tt></b> directive specifies some parameters about Phase 2.
anonymous means to match any peer.
You can limit the exchange to each peer, but the document does not describes it.

<li><b><tt>pfs_group</tt></b> directive specifies a group
for Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange on Phase 2.
Racoon can use 1, 2 and 5 as this group.
You must specify <i>1</i>, <i>2</i> and <i>5</i> respectively.

<li><b><tt>lifetime time</tt></b> and <b><tt>lifetime byte</tt></b> specify
the lifetime of IPsec-SA.  These are by time and by bytes respectively.
You can use <i>sec</i>, <i>min</i> and <i>hour</i> as the unit of lifetime by time.
And you can use <i>B</i>, <i>KB</i>, <i>MB</i> and <i>TB</i> as the unit of lifetime by bytes.

<li><b><tt>encryption_algorithm</tt></b> directive specifies
the proposal of encryption algorithm for ESP.
racoon can use DES, 3DES, CAST, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, RIJNDAEL
and NULL as encryption algorithm for ESP.
3des, cast128, blowfish, des, twofish, rijndael ;

You must specify <i>des</i>, <i>3des</i>, <i>cast</i>, <i>blowfish</i>,
<i>twofish</i>, <i>rijndael</i> and <i>null_enc</i> respectively.

<li><b><tt>authentication_algorithm</tt></b> directive specifies the proposal of authentication algorithm for both ESP and AH.
racoon can use HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-MD5 and Keyed-MD5 as authentication algorithm.
You must specify <i>hmac_sha1</i>, <i>hmac_md5</i> and <i>kpdk</i> respectively.

<li><b><tt>compression_algorithm</tt></b> directive specifies
the proposal of compression algorithm for IPCOMP.
racoon can use DEFLATE at the moment.
You must specify <i>deflate</i>.
</ul>

<blockquote>
<em>NOTE</em>:
Racoon does not have the list of security protocols to be negotiated.
The list of security protocols are passed by the kernel.
Beforehand you have to define all of the potential algorithms into the
<b><tt>sainfo</tt></b> even if you do not need any compression algorithms.
</blockquote>

<p>
The above sample can accept to exchange both Phase 1 and Phase 2, only if you specify appropriate Pre-shared Key before exchange.
Racoon can restrict to exchange with the peer each phases.
But this document does not describe the way.

<h2>
Sample Configuration of SPD
</h2>

<h3>
Case 1
</h3>
Security protocol is <b><i>ESP</i></b>.
Encapsulation mode is <b><i>Transport</i></b>.

<pre>
	   Host-A                        Host-B
	  fec0::1 ---------------------- fec0::2
</pre>

<br>
Configuration at Host-A:
<pre>
	# setkey -c &lt;&lt;EOF
	spdadd <b>fec0::1</b> <b>fec0::2</b> any -P <b>out</b> ipsec
		esp/transport//require ;
	spdadd <b>fec0::2</b> <b>fec0::1</b> any -P <b>in</b> ipsec
		esp/transport//require ;
	EOF
</pre>

Note that IP address and direction.
First IP address means source of IP header.
Next IP address means destination of IP header.
<b>out</b> means a packet goes out.
<b>in</b> means a packet comes in.

<p>
At Host-B:
<pre>
	# setkey -c &lt;&lt;EOF
	spdadd <b>fec0::2</b> <b>fec0::1</b> any -P <b>out</b> ipsec
		esp/transport//require ;
	spdadd <b>fec0::1</b> <b>fec0::2</b> any -P <b>in</b> ipsec
		esp/transport//require ;
	EOF
</pre>

<h3>
Case 2
</h3>
<b><i>ESP</i></b> <b><i>Transport</b></i> mode applied first
and <b><i>AH</i></b> <b><i>Transport</b></i> mode next.<br>
It means that kernel makes a packet to be [IP|AH|ESP|ULP].
</pre>

<pre>
	   Host-A                        Host-B
	  fec0::1 ---------------------- fec0::2
</pre>

Configuration at Host-A:
<pre>
	# setkey -c &lt;&lt;EOF
	spdadd fec0::1 fec0::2 any -P <b>out</b> ipsec
		<b>esp</b>/transport//require
		<b>ah</b>/transport//require ;
	spdadd fec0::2 fec0::1 any -P <b>in</b> ipsec
		<b>esp</b>/transport//require
		<b>ah</b>/transport//require ;
	EOF
</pre>

Note that the ordering of security protocol.
In outgoing case defined <b>out</b>,
it specifies the sequence of security protocol which kernel apply to the packet.
In incoming case defined <b>in</b>,
it specifies the sequence of security protocol to be applied to the packet.
The above case means that ESP transport mode is first,
and the next is AH transport mode.
<p>
At Host-B:
<pre>
	# setkey -c &lt;&lt;EOF
	spdadd fec0::2 fec0::1 any -P out ipsec
		esp/transport//require
		ah/transport//require ;
	spdadd fec0::1 fec0::2 any -P in ipsec
		esp/transport//require
		ah/transport//require ;
	EOF
</pre>

Note IP addresses as case 1.

<h3>
Case 3
</h3>
<b><i>ESP</i></b> <b><i>Tunnel</i></b> for VPN.

<pre>
			       ======= ESP =======
			       |                 |
	   Network-A       Gateway-A         Gateway-B        Network-B
	  10.0.1.0/24 ---- 172.16.0.1 ------ 172.16.0.2 ---- 10.0.2.0/24
</pre>

<br>
Configuration at Gateway-A:
<pre>
	# setkey -c &lt;&lt;EOF
	spdadd 10.0.1.0/24 10.0.2.0/24 any -P out ipsec
		esp/tunnel/<b>172.16.0.1-172.16.0.2</b>/require ;
	spdadd 10.0.2.0/24 10.0.1.0/24 any -P in ipsec
		esp/tunnel/<b>172.16.0.2-172.16.0.1</b>/require ;
</pre>

Tunnel end points must be defined.

<p>
and at Gateway-B:
<pre>
	# setkey -c &lt;&lt;EOF
	spdadd 10.0.2.0/24 10.0.1.0/24 any -P out ipsec
		esp/tunnel/<b>172.16.0.2-172.16.0.1</b>/require ;
	spdadd 10.0.1.0/24 10.0.2.0/24 any -P in ipsec
		esp/tunnel/<b>172.16.0.1-172.16.0.2</b>/require ;

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
This document explains basic mechanism to establish IPsec-SA automatically,
and describes how to configure to establish IPsec-SA automatically
in each typical IPsec environment with simple configuration sample of racoon.
It is necessary to know many parameters if you want complex configuration
of racoon.  You may refer racoon.conf(5) for that reason, and
the other document will explain about detail configuration.
