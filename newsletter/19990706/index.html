<HR>

Recently we got several emails about how you can hook your site up to 6bone, 
when you have security gateway (packet filters) on your IPv4 router.
<P>

The configuration for Checkpoint Firewall-1 is provided by Mr. Tetsuhiro Nakane.
Thanks!

<HR>

<H2>Basics</H2>

Most of 6bone connetion is done by RFC1933 IPv6-to-IPv4 tunnel.
The packet will look like this:

                         6667 6869
</PRE>

All you need to do is to let the packet go through the firewall gateway.
The packet has IPv4 protocol number field (<TT>ip->ip_p</TT>) of 41
(0x29), which is marked with red color on the above packet dump.
You may also want to restrict IPv4 source address and destination address,
to make sure that no malicious IPv6 tunnels can be established.

<H2>Configuring Checkpoint Firewall-1</H2>
Suppose you have
<A HREF=http://www.checkpoint.com/>Checkpoint</A> Firewall-1 (FW-1)
between your tunnel endpoint (A) and the peer (B).
<PRE>
A ==== FW-1 ==== B		IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel between A and B
</PRE>
To allow IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel to go through FW-1, please take the
following steps:
<OL>
<LI>Create new srevice called "IPv6-over-IPv4", with service type "Other".
<LI>Add "Match" with "ip_p = 41".
<LI>Now you have this configuration, which allows packets with IPv4 protocol
	type of 41 to go through, but no others.
<PRE>
rule    Src     Dst    Service         Action
----------------------------------------------
1       A,B     B,A    IPv6-over-IPv4  Accept
2       A,B     B,A    Any             Reject
</PRE>
</OL>

If you can make it more loose, you can allow any packet between A and
B to go through, like:
<PRE>
rule    Src     Dst     Service Action
--------------------------------------
1       A,B      B,A    Any     Accept
</PRE>

<H2>Securing 6bone connection</H2>

While 6bone is still a small network, it is good to be cautious.
You may want to implement IPv6 packet filters onto your 6bone connection.
KAME for FreeBSD228 and FreeBSD32 includes <TT>ip6fw</TT>,
which is capable of filtering IPv6 packet.
You may want to configure this into your inbound IPv6 router.
<P>

Also, KAME kit includes ports/pkgsrc directory for IPv6-ready fwtk,
Coutesy of Mr. Hajime Umemoto.
You would like to have tcp relay, this is the answer.
But if you implement fwtk, you cannot enjoy direct IPv6 connection from
your end node to outside.
<P>

Please note that NAT provides no security at all,
so there will be no IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT.
