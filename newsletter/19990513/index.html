<H2>Introduction</H2>

In the <A HREF=../19981224/>previous newsletter</A>,
we have described how you can connect to the world 6bone
(worldwide IPv6 experimental network).
However, the previous newsletter talks mostly about the case where
you have fixed IPv4 global address.
This time, we would like to talk about the cases wheree you have
dynamic IPv4 address, usually assigned dynamically on IPv4 dialup ppp
connection, from your ISP.

<H2>Dynamic IPv4 address and RFC1933 IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnel</H2>

<A HREF=ftp://ftp.iij.ad.jp/pub/rfc/rfc1933.txt>RFC1933</A> describes
IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnel, which is the most widely deployed
mechanism to connect to the world 6bone.
This uses IPv4 as underlying medium, and establish IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel
between two fixed IPv4 global address.
<P>

There are problems with RFC1933 tunnel,
for commodity IPv4 users who use IPv4 dialup ppp connection:
<UL>
<LI>IPv4 address needs to be fixed for both end of the tunnel.
	For IPv4 dialup ppp user, it is very hard to get a "fixed" IPv4 address.
<LI>IPv4 dialup ppp users tend to use NAT router box, to connect multiple
	nodes in her home using single IPv4 global address given from the ISP.
	For RFC1933 tunnel, IPv4 address needs to be "global" IPv4 address,
	not the private IPv4 address (used behind NAT boxes).
	So, the tunnel endpoint cannot be placed behind the NAT box.
</UL>

There are several techniques to go around the first problem,
and few techniques to go around the second problem.
For the following sections, we first assume that you have IPv4 global address
assigned to your IPv4/v6 dual stack box (which will become the tunnel endpoint
and the IPv6 border router for your home).
In the last section of the document we'll give some hint for NAT box users.

<H2>freenet6.net and tunnel broker</H2>

<A HREF=http://www.freenet6.net/>freenet6.net</A>
and CSELT provides a dynamic tunnel configuration service,
by using IPv4-accessible webpage.
When you sign up, they will assign you a fixed IPv6 subnet address to you.
You can ask them (by using web interface) to establish a
RFC1933 tunnel dynamically, to your current IPv4 global address.
<PRE>

  | 192.168.0.2		  | 192.168.0.x

</PRE>

This works like this:
<UL>
<LI>First, you click the freenet6.net webpage, to sign up for fixed IPv6
	subnet address.
	You can use the IPv6 address for your home network,
	even when you are not connected to the outside.
	They will even delegate you a domain name (if you are in Japan,
	it will be like <TT>yourname.jp.freenet6.net</TT>)
	so that you can publish a IPv6 web server to 6bone.
<LI>When you wish to connect to outside IPv6 network:
	<OL>
	<LI>You will be connecting to your IPv4 ISP.
		You get a IPv4 global address assigned to you.
	<LI>Click the webpage to tell your current IPv4 global address to
		freenet6.net server.
	<LI>They will configure RFC1933 tunnel toward you, and gives you a
		shell script for configuration on your side.
	<LI>Run the shell script on your dual stack box, to configure RFC1933
		tunnel on your side.
	</OL>

<H2>Trumpet dynamic tunnel configuration protocol</H2>

KAME kit includes two programs, <TT>dtcps</TT> and <TT>dtcpc</TT>,
in <TT>kit/src/dtcp</TT>.
Installed programs will be placed in <TT>/usr/local/v6/sbin</TT>.
This implements "Dynamic Tunnel Configuration Protocol", proposed by
Trumpet.
The protocol is described in
<A HREF=http://jazz-1.trumpet.com.au/ipv6-draft/dtcp-draft-prt-13-may-1999.htm>
this document</A>.
Those programs implement APOP-like authentication protocol for establishing
RFC1933 tunnel between two end.
If you can ask your 6bone upstream to provide dtcp server, you may be
able to use this.
<P>

You'll first need to setup a password (shared secret) on the upstream
so that you can authenticate yourself to the upstream.
dtcps awaits IPv4 TCP connection from dtcpc, just like pop server awaits
connection from mailers.
When connection is made, dtcps will throw a challenge
(random hexadecimal string).
dtcpc asks you the password locally, and throw a response
(keyed MD5 result from challenge and the password).
dtcps throws the configuration parameter and RFC1933 tunnel will be established.
<PRE>
dual stack router	upstream

		IPv4 TCP connection
	   <---------------
		challenge
	   --------------->
		response
	   <---------------
		the configuration parameter
	   <-------------->
		tunnel established
</PRE>

Current implementation simply configures the tunnel between two end.
To actually use this, global IPv6 address assignment has to be
performed offline.
Also, both end needs to perform routing information exchange.
<P>

dtcps and dtcpc are written in Ruby scripting language
(with IPv6 modification), and Ruby needs to be installed beforehand.
Please use <TT>kit/ports/ruby</TT> for easy installation.
Manpages are available in KAME kit so consult these for details.

<H2>v6tun: IPv6 tunnel over ssh</H2>

For KAME/FreeBSD, you can use v6tun (in <TT>kit/ports/v6tun</TT>).
This automates "IPv6 tunnel over ssh" configuration toward your 6bone upstream.
This is not based on RFC1933, but it uses FreeBSD <TT>tun</TT>
tunnelling device.
In this case, you'll need an ssh login account on your 6bone upstream.
Also, you'll need <TT>tun</TT> tunnelling device configured in your kernel.
<P>

When you use v6tun, v6tun will login to your upstream tunnel endpoint
using ssh.
Then, it  will configure IPv6 tunnel over ssh link, like this.
<PRE>
dual stack router			upstream
	   ------------------------------->
		ssh login
	   <------------------------------>

<H2>Special configuration for NAT box</H2>

If you use NAT box to connect to your IPv4 ISP, your home network is
something like this:
<PRE>
your ISP
  |
  | phone line
  |
  | IPv4-global-address
NAT router box
  | 192.168.0.1
==+=======================+== 192.168.0.0/24
  | 192.168.0.2		  | 192.168.0.x
dual stack box		random other nodes
</PRE>

Here, you would like to somehow hook the dual stack box (192.168.0.2) to
the world 6bone, by using RFC1933 tunnel.
Here are very few possibilities:
<OL>
<LI>Replace NAT box with dual stack box.
<LI>Configure NAT box to statically route IP protocol type 41, to 192.168.0.2
</OL>

The simplest solution is to dump NAT box, and make dual stack box perform
both IPv4 NAT and IPv6 router.
I recommend this because NAT box does too many tricky things
we cannot even imagine.
Recent PC UNIX families implement NAT in the kernel.
KAME kit (for FreeBSD2.2.8 and BSDI3.1) also includes
home-brew NAT code as well.
<PRE>
your ISP
  |
  | phone line
  |
  | IPv4-global-address
dual stack box
  | 192.168.0.1
==+=======================+== 192.168.0.0/24
  | 192.168.0.2		  | 192.168.0.x
			random other nodes
</PRE>
For IPv4, you'll be configuring dual stack box to perform NAT for
network in your home (192.168.0.0/24).
This is out of the scope of the document so please refer to
OS-specific documents.
You'll be configuring RFC1933 tunnel by using your dual stack box,
and route IPv6 packet for the network in your home.
<P>

Next solution is to configure your NAT box to statically route IP packet
with protocol number 41, to your dual stack box (192.168.0.2).
RFC1933 tunnel uses protocol number 41.
In this case, you will need other tricky configurations.
This depends on your network configuration, your NAT box implementation,
and your IPv6 upstream, so I cannot discuss this in a generic way.
