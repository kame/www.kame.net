<hr>

This document is a brief instruction to play with IPv6 DNS server
discovery using (stateless) DHCPv6.

<h2>1. Installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li> Get the latest KAME snap kit at <a href="http://www.kame.net/">
  the project web page.</a>
  20030414 version should work as described here.
  <li> Go down to the dhcp6 source directory.  It should be located at
  kame/kame/kame/dhcp6.
  <li> Build the DHCPv6 kit.  The following simple procedure should
  work at least for the corresponding KAME snap system:
<pre>
% ./configure
% make
# make install
</pre>
  <li> Be sure to install the server (dhcp6s) to the server machine,
  and the client (dhcp6c) to all client hosts.
</ol>

<h2>2. Server Configuration</h2>

First, add the following to your server configuration file
(which is /usr/local/etc/dhcp6s.conf by default):

<pre>
option domain-name-servers DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS;
</pre>

where DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS is the IPv6 numeric address of the DNS
server.

Multiple addresses can be specified by multiple 'option' statements.

Then start the server:

<pre>
# dhcp6s IFNAME
</pre>

where IFNAME is the interface that the server should receive requests
from clients.
Multiple interfaces can be specified as multiple arguments.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> DHCPv6 relay agent provided by KAME is based on a quite
old version of the specification and is not inter-operable with the
server and client implementation.
Thus, the server should be located on the same link as the client.

<h2>3. Host Configuration</h2>

<h3>3.1. DHCPv6 Client Configuration</h3>

Add the following to your server configuration file
(which is /usr/local/etc/dhcp6c.conf by default):

<pre>
interface IFNAME {
	information-only;
	request domain-name-servers;
	script "SCRIPT_PATH";
};
</pre>

where IFNAME is the interface name, like "fxp0", on which the host
machine is connected to the network, and SCRIPT_PATH is an absolute
path to a script file which processes DNS server addresses given by
the sever.

<h3>3.2. Client Script</h3>

If you do not mind to override the /etc/resolv.conf file, the
following simple script should be fine:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

rm /etc/resolv.conf
for nameserver in $new_domain_name_servers; do
      echo nameserver $nameserver >>/etc/resolv.conf
done
</pre>

This is exactly what <a href="http://www.isc.org/products/DHCP/">ISC dhclient
</a> does with regards to DNS server addresses.
<p>
Save this file to somewhere in the client machine.
<p>
Assuming the script file is /sbin/dhcp6c-script and the DHCPv6 client
interface is fxp0, a complete example of dhcp6c.conf is:

<pre>
interface fxp0 {
	information-only;
	request domain-name-servers;
	script "/sbin/dhcp6c-script";
};
</pre>

<h3>3.3. Start the Client</h3>

Then invoke the client:
<pre>
# dhcp6c fxp0
</pre>

That's it.  The client should be able to get DNS server addresses from
the server, and will update /etc/resolv.conf accordingly.

<h2>4. Interaction with Router Advertisement</h2>

If the router(s) serving for the client host has the ability to set
the "Other Configuration (O)" flag of router advertisement, you can
automatically (re)invoke the DHCPv6 client upon receipt of
advertisements with the flag being set.
This can be done by the latest rtsold(8) daemon with the -O flag.
<p>
The following subsections describe the procedure.

<h3>4.1 Router Configuration</h3>

If you are using a KAME PC router and the rtadvd(8) daemon for router
advertisements, you'll be able to set the O flag with the following
configuration:
<pre>
fxp0:[backslash]
	:raflags#64:
</pre>
where [backslash] is the backslash character.
(You may need to change the interface name "fxp0" appropriately.)
If you have installed the latest version of rtadvd from KAME
snapshots, you can also specify the flag is a string notation:
<pre>
fxp0:[backslash]
	:raflags="o":
</pre>

<h3>4.2 Host Configuration</h3>

First, prepare a script file that (re)invokes the DHCPv6 client.
It should be like this:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

IFNAME=$1
PIDFILE=/var/run/dhcp6c.pid

if [ -f ${PIDFILE} ]; then
	kill -HUP `cat ${PIDFILE}`
else
	/usr/local/sbin/dhcp6c $IFNAME
fi
</pre>

Put this script somewhere in the client host machine
(we assume "/sbin/start-dhcp6c").
<p>
Then invoke the rtsold(8) daemon (which should be built from the
latest KAME snapshot):
<pre>
# rtsold -O /sbin/start-dhcp6c IFNAME
</pre>

When the daemon receives a router advertisement with the O flag on, it
will invoke the start-dhcp6c script, which will then (re)start the
DHCPv6 client.

If the host machine moves from link to link, you may also want to
specify the -m option to the rtsold daemon.
