There has been unified-ipv6 project underway, since winter 1998 (IIRC).
This project aims to make a "take the best part" IPv6 implementation from
NRL, INRIA and KAME implementation.
This was needed because if we have 3 IPv6 implementations and 4 *BSD operating
systems we will get 12 different IPv6-ready operating systems, which is a 
huge mess and it raises big portability problem.
<P>

After half year of struggle on manpower and design issues
(apparently 3 IPv6 code are based on very different designs),
the situation changed a bit.
<UL>
<LI>NRL decided to concentrate onto IPsec.
<LI>INRIA will be doing their researches on top of KAME code.
<LI>KAME will be adding necessary knobs to support INRIA's experiment.
</UL>

So, KAME will be producing KAME snapshots, and we label it as
"unified-ipv6" snapshot.
This will happen when KAME supports OpenBSD and BSDI4
(expected to happen in September).
<P>

We hope to ship unified-ipv6 kit (basically KAME kit), and merge code to
*BSD platforms sooner.
