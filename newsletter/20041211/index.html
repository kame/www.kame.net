<h2>Overview</h2>
The KAME Mobile IPv6 stack had been developped for long time.
Now, it enoughly works well and is regarded reference code. 
However, it cause a kernel size enlarged since the most of codes are implemented in the kernel side.
Addition the kernel enlargement problem, there are other probelms that 
implementing in kernel makes it difficult to debug and improve some extensions.
<P>
On the other hand, the current Mobile IPv6 specification introduced a new extention header, mobility header, to convey mobile ip signaling packet. 
This decision makes it possibe to implement mobile IPv6 stack on userland.
<p>
In WIDE project, another Moble IPv6 code for BSDs had been developed by SFC in Keio University.
They also faced similar problems to us.
Therefore we have agreed to unify and re-design our implementations.
<p>
The new MIP6 code is named 'SHISA' which is derived from a traditional roof ornament of Okinawa, a tropical island in Japan, because the first developping camp was held in Okinawa in April, 2004.
We had almost done the work by October and attended <a href="http://www.etsi.org">ETSI</a> IPv6 plugtests event to confirm its interoperability.


<h2>What were changed ?</h2>
From a operetain view, some points are changed.
<DL>
  <DT>Userland
  <DD>Most of parts especially signaling are moved to user land.
      Userland programs are separated to four parts for each functions.
  <DT>Home address assignement
  <DD>Home addresses are not assigned automatically.
      You should specify it explicitly.
  <DT>Supported NEMO protocol
  <DD>NEMO Basic protocol is implemented by default.
  <DT>Getting BCE/BUL informations
  <DD>'mip6control' is no longer supported.
      You can use telnet interfaces to get mobility status or informations.
</dl>


<h2>Status</h2>
The current Shisa is based on RFC3775, RFC3776, draft-ietf-nemo-basic-03 and draft-wakikawa-mobileip-multiplecoa-03.
It works on FreeBSD 4.10, FreeBSD 5.3 and NetBSD 1.6.2.
OpenBSD edition isn't ported yet.
But note that FreeBSD 4.10 will not supported in kame snap soon as announced on snap-users mailing list.
<P>
But, there remains some work to do such as:
<ul>
  <li>Mobile Prefix Discovery
  <li>Treating L bit in Binding update
  <li>DAD for a home address on a home link
  <li>Configuration files
  <li>Good documentation
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Shisa</h2>
There is a good documentation of usage MIP6 and NEMO.
Please refer <a href="http://www.mobileip.jp/shisa-readme.pdf">here</a>(pdf).
<!--
<h3>Getting source code</h3>
You have to get the latest kame snap after as possible at <a href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME Project</a> web site.

<h3>Preparing</h3>
<h4>Kernel</h4>
You have to bulid a mobile IPv6 enabled kernel with configuring 'options MIP6'.
'Options MIP6_DEBUG' might be useful if you try to find problems.
<BR>
Also you have to add 'pseudo-device mip &lt;number&gt' configuration when you build mobile node.
On FreeBSD 5, it would be 'device mip &lt;number&gt'.
The number of the device indicate the number of interfaces to allocate home address.
Normally, '1' is enough.
The device doesn't cause any problems if you don't configure it.
So, you can use it even if it's not a mobile node.

<h4>Userland</h4>
You need Mobile IP capable commands besides some shisa daemons.
What commands you should add -DMIP6 are 'rtadvd' and 'ifconfig'.
Addtion them, you should build and install commands under 'shisad'.

<h3>For Mobile IPv6</h3>
<h4>Setup</h4>

<h5>Home Agent</h5>
Prior MIP6 configuration, you should setup for IPv6 router configuration.
<blockquote><PRE>
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv=0
</PRE></blockquote>
Assign addresses to interfaces, set route.
Assign DHAAD anycast adderss on a home link.
<blockquote><PRE>
# ifconfig &lt;homelink interface&gt inet6 &lt;home prefix&gt;fdff:ffff:ffff:fffe prefixlen 64 anycast
</PRE></blockquote>
<P>
If you will protect signaling packets between a mobile node(it is recommended and normal), turn a switch on, and setup security associations.
<blockquote><PRE>
# sysctl net.inet6.mip6.ipsec=1
</PRE></blockquote>
Currently, A way of setting securtiy associations is the same as before. Plerease refer the section 'Create IPsec configuration files' of the document <a href="../20031007/index.html">KAME Mobile IPv6 How To</a>.
<P>
Start home agent daemon, had, and correspondent node daemon, cnd.
<blockquote><PRE>
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/had -i &lt;home link&gt -n
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/cnd -n
</PRE></blockquote>


<h5>Mobile Node</h5>
A mobile node works as an IPv6 host.
<blockquote><PRE>
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=0
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv=1
</PRE></blockquote>
Assign home address on mip?? interfaces with 'home' flag.
<blockquote><PRE>
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/ifconfig mip0 inet6 &lt;home address&gt prefixlen 64 home
</PRE></blockquote>
Start mobile node related daemons.
<blockquote><PRE>
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/mnd -i mip??
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/mdd
</PRE></blockquote>


<h5>Correspondent Node</h5>
Just start a correspondent node daemon.
<blockquote><PRE>
# /usr/local/v6/sbin/cnd -n
</PRE></blockquote>
-->

<h5>Using IPsec</h5>
If you will protect signaling packets between a mobile node(it is recommended and normal), turn a switch on, and setup security associations.
<blockquote><PRE>
# sysctl net.inet6.mip6.ipsec=1
</PRE></blockquote>
Currently, setting securtiy associations is the same way as before. Please refer the section 'Create IPsec configuration files' of the document <a href="../20031007/index.html">KAME Mobile IPv6 How To</a>.
<P>

<h5>the Most Convinient Way</h5>
For FreeBSD and NetBSD users, a special rc script to be able to describe MIP6 configuration in /etc/rc.conf is provided.
To use this feature, you have to copy the rc scripts from $(kame)/$(bsd)/etc/.
<P>
Following keywords are defined:
<DL>
  <DT>ipv6_mobile_enable &lt;All&gt
  <DD>(bool) if set to 'YES', mobile IPv6 is supported. At least correspondent node functionality is enabled if others are not set.
  <DT>ipv6_mobile_nodetype &lt;All&gt
  <DD>(str) Select from 'mobile_node', 'correspondent_node', or 'home_agent'.
  <DT>ipv6_mobile_security &lt;Home Agent / Mobile Node&gt
  <DD>(bool) if set to 'NO', the node accepts packets not protected with IPsec.
      But it is not recommended using 'NO' except on experimental network. 
      If set to 'YES', you have to setup IPsec parameters.
  <DT>ipv6_mobile_home_interface &lt;Home Agent&gt
  <DD>(str) Specify a home link.
</DL>

This is a template for a home agent
<blockquote><table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><PRE>
# These are the same as a traditional IPv6 router setting
ipv6_enable="YES"
ipv6_gateway_enable="YES"
ipv6_network_interfaces="xx"
ipv6_ifconfig_xx="xxxx"
ipv6_default_router="xxxx"

# For Home Agent
ipv6_mobile_enable="YES"
ipv6_mobile_nodetype="home_agent"
ipv6_mobile_securtiy_enable="YES"

ipv6_mobile_home_interfaces="xx"
</PRE></td></tr></table></blockquote>

Here is a template for a mobile node.
You have to specify home address statically.
<blockquote><table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><PRE>
# IPv6 host setting
ipv6_enable="YES"
ipv6_gateway_enable="NO"

# For MN
ipv6_mobile_enable="YES"
ipv6_network_interfaces="mip0"
ipv6_ifconfig_mip0="&lt;&lt;Your home address&gt;&gt prefixlen 64 home"
ipv6_mobile_nodetype="mobile_node"
ipv6_mobile_security_enable="xx"
</PRE></td></tr></table></blockquote>
