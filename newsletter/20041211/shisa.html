<h1>New mobility support code in KAME</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The KAME Mobile IPv6 stack had been developped for long time.  Now, it
enoughly works well and is regarded reference code.  However, it cause
a kernel size enlarged since the most of codes are implemented in the
kernel side.  In addition to the kernel enlargement problem, there are
other problems that implementing in kernel makes it difficult to debug
and improve some extensions.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the current Mobile IPv6 specification introduced a
new extention header, mobility header, to convey mobile ip signaling
packet.  This decision makes it possibe to implement mobile IPv6 stack
on userland.
</p>

<p>
In WIDE project, another Moble IPv6 code for BSDs had been developed
by SFC in Keio University.  They also faced similar problems to us.
Therefore we have agreed to unify and re-design our implementations.
</p>

<p>
The new Mobile IPv6 code is named 'SHISA' which is derived from a
traditional roof ornament of Okinawa, a tropical island in Japan,
because the first developping camp was held in Okinawa in April 2004.
In the initial stage, SHISA was being developed independently (<a
href="http://www.mobileip.jp/">www.mobileip.jp</a>) from the KAME
project.  We had almost done the work on the basic functions by
October 2004 and had confirmed interoperability at the <a
href="http://www.etsi.org">ETSI</a> IPv6 plugtests event.  Based on
the result, we thought it is time to merge the code to the KAME source
code and start distributing the code as a part of the KAME
distribution.
</p>

<p>
Since December 2004, we are distributing the new code called SHISA
which supports not only Mobile IPv6 but also NEMO as a part of
mobility functions provided by the KAME project.

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>
We will issue newsletters when we provide any documentation about the
mobility code.  Please take a look at <a href="../index.html">the
newsletter page</a>.


<h2>Acknowledgment</h2>

<p>
We thank the following people and project who tested and reported bugs
of the pre-release version of the code.  Their contribution helped us
to make the initial version of the code.
