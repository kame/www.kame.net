<hr>
<h2><a name="background">1. background</a></h2>
Here's the list of reasons why we would like to terminate freebsd4+kame support.
<ul>	
<li>KAME's development resource is limited and KAME would like to concentrate
the precious resource to protocols, rather than the OS diversities
<li>freebsd4+kame based on FreeBSD-4.11 has been released in Jan 2005, and FreeBSD Project has no plan to release FreeBSD-4.12
<li>freebsd5+kame is stable enough at least for hacking purpose.  Please note that KAME-SNAP is originally for hackers/researchers who want to develop a new features. (see <a href="http://www.kame.net/project-overview.html#release">the project overview</a>)
<li>Those who want to use a stable IPv6 implementation can use the original releases of *BSD, which includes the stable portion of KAME-SNAP implementations.
</ul>

<h2><a name="changes">2. what will happen after March 31 2005</a></h2>
we will conduct the following changes after March 31 2005.
<ul>
<li> the removal of FreeBSD4-specific ifdefs from KAME-SNAP
<li> the termination of generating KAME-SNAP tarball for freebsd4
</ul>

Even after Mar 31 2005, however, we still keeps the following two
regarding freebsd4.
<ul>
<li> the CVS repository of kame/freebsd4 (just for reference)
<li> the old freebsd4+kame tarballs in our FTP site
</ul>

<h2><a name="actions">3. what should the freebsd4 users have to do?</a></h2>

Those who are now using kame+freebsd4 have to choose either of the
following ways.
<dl>
<dt> upgrade your kame+freebsd4 to kame+freebsd5
<dd> <p>If you find something unstable, please confirm it on pure freebsd5 to check if it's a generic freebsd5 problem or a KAME-specific problem.</p>
 <ul>
 <li> If it's a generic freebsd5 problem, please report it to freebsd-stable@freebsd.org or freebsd-net@freebsd.org, to improve the quality of freebsd.  
 <li> If it's KAME-specific problem, please enjoy hacking it!
 </ul>

<dt>keep using kame+freebsd4 and merge necessary fixes as you wish.
<dd>
<p>We keep old KAME-snap tarball in our FTP site and you can still access the CVS repository of kame/freebsd4.</p>
<p>So using these resources, you can still install kame+freebsd4 from scratch.  (we will remove freebsd4-specific ifdef's from the code in kame/kame/... from this April, so it will be difficult to sync with the current KAME CVS on freebsd4)
</p>
