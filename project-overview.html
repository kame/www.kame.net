<h1 id="overview">Overview of the KAME Project</h1>

<p>
The KAME Project is a joint effort to create a single solid software set,
especially targeting IPv6/IPsec.  Talented researchers from several
Japanese organizations joined the project.  This joint effort will
avoid unnecessary duplicated development in the same area, and effectively
provide a high quality, advanced featured package. 
</p>

<p>
The KAME Project aims to provide FREE reference implementations of
</p>

<ul>
<li>IPv6</li>
<li>IPsec (for both IPv4 and IPv6)</li>
<li>advanced internetworking such as advanced packet queuing,
mobility, and whatever interesting</li>
</ul>

<p>
on BSD variants.
</p>

<p>
Currently several BSD variants are being developed including FreeBSD,
NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
They are developing/improving network code (<TT>sys/netinet</TT> tree)
separately.
</p>

<p>
Heterogeneity is always important, but we did not have a single shared
reference code for IPv6 networking when we started the project.
In IPv4 days we had had a good reference
implementation, such as UCB Network Releases.
When considering to use IPv6, there had already been several choices.
The problem here was, even if *BSD
projects chose a single IPv6 stack to merge into themselves,
the code would be maintained by each project separately and the code
would likely be quite different on each project tree.
</p>

<p>
We thus formed this project to implement and maintain the best
available code for IPv4/IPv6/IPsec/whatever, which would be the single
base of advanced internetworking technologies.
</p>

<p>
The KAME project was started as a 2-year project (April 1998 - March 2000).
It has got extension for 2 years several times,
so will be until March 2006 at this moment.
Core researchers are from the following companies (in alphabetical order):
</p>

<ul>
<li>Ken'ichi Kudou (<a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/">Fujitsu Limited</a>)
</li>
<li>Shinsuke Suzuki (<a href="http://www.hitachi.co.jp/">Hitachi, Ltd.</a>)
</li>
<li>Jun-ichiro Hagino (<a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/">Internet
Initiative Japan Inc.</a>)
</li>
<li>Kazuhiko Yamamoto (<a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/">Internet
Initiative Japan Inc.</a>)</li>
<li>Keiichi Shima (<a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/">Internet
Initiative Japan Inc.</a>)</li>
</li>
<li>Keisuke Uehara (<a href="http://www.keio.ac.jp/">Keio University</a>)
</li>
<li>Ryuji Wakikawa (<a href="http://www.keio.ac.jp/">Keio University</a>)
</li>
<li>Koshiro Mitsuya(<a href="http://www.keio.ac.jp/">Keio University</a>)
</li>
<li>Tsuyoshi Momose (<a href="http://www.nec.co.jp/">NEC Corporation</a>)
</li>
<li>Tatuya Jinmei (<a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/">Toshiba
Corporation</a>)
</li>
<li>Shoichi Sakane (<a href="http://www.yokogawa.co.jp/">Yokogawa Electric Corporation</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Core researchers have committed to working on the project as the
primary assignment at their organization (it is not a hobby for us).
Our most important task is to implement the best networking code
possible, under the BSD copyright.
Also note that we provide the achievement as Free software,
since we are much interested in usage of this stack in many ways. 
Thus stability is one of the very important goals for us.
</p>

<p>
KAME's code is based on WIDE <em>Hydrangea</em> IPv6/IPsec stack. We are now
merging several other codes provided by the above researchers,
implementing and improving the software.

<h1 id="release">Releasing Plan</h1>

<p>
We plan to release KAME kit in two ways:
</p>

REVISE

<dl>
<dt><a href="/snap-users/">SNAP</a> is for hackers/researchers.
</dt>
<dd>	Will be released once a week (every Monday).
	It will include whole bunch of experimental items.
	It may not be stable (sometimes doesn't even compile).

	We develop KAME code on top of 3 BSD variants and 3 different versions:
	<ul>
	<li>FreeBSD 5.3</li>
	<li>NetBSD 2.0</li>
	<li>OpenBSD 3.6</li>
	</ul>

	We share most of IPv6/IPsec code among *BSD platforms,
	so they are in-sync in most cases.
</dd>
<dt>Integrated *BSD source code tree
</dt>
<dd>	For normal users.
	You just need to install official releases from *BSD projects.

	The following official releases integrates KAME kit:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD"</a> 4.0 and beyond</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD"</a> 1.5 and beyond</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD"</a> 2.7 and beyond</li>
	<li>BSD/OS 4.2 and beyond</li>
	</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The difference between KAME SNAP kit and *BSD releses would be like below:
</p>

<ol>

REVISE IT!!!

<li>KAME SNAP kit comes with more experimental protocols/APIs support and
	userland programs.
	This would attract researchers more, as not everything in
	KAME tree will be merged into *BSD tree (due to discussions, spec
	maturity, and other reasons).
</li>
<li>KAME kit will always be based on public release version of *BSD, so you
	can enjoy latest IPv6 tree on top of stable *BSD platforms.
	This would be nice feature to have when your goal is to do IPv6
	experiment, not to chase *BSD-current.
</li>
<li>The merged *BSD releases will give tightly integrated IPv6-ready operating
	system.
	KAME kit is supplied as diffs to *BSD release versions,
	so it has less integrated feeling (we are trying our best, though).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In other words, even if *BSD group ships KAME-integrated official releases,
we will continue our work and ship KAME kit for them.
</p>

<p>
A document named
<a href="http://orange.kame.net/dev/cvsweb2.cgi/kame/COVERAGE?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">COVERAGE</a>
is supplied with KAME kits, and gives gory details about differences
between KAME/*BSD and *BSD official releases.
</p>

<p>
In the past we had KAME STABLE and KAME RELEASE kits.
<a href="ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/mail-list/snap-users/3306">
They were discontinued</a>.
