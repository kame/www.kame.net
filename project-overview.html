<h1 id="overview">Overview of the KAME Project</h1>

<p>
The KAME Project is a joint effort to create a single solid software set,
especially targeting IPv6/IPsec.  Talented researchers from several
Japanese organizations joined the project.  This joint effort will
avoid unnecessary duplicated development in the same area, and effectively
provide a high quality, advanced featured package. 
</p>

<p>
The KAME Project aims to provide FREE reference implementations of
</p>

<ul>
<li>IPv6</li>
<li>IPsec (for both IPv4 and IPv6)</li>
<li>advanced internetworking such as advanced packet queuing,
mobility, and whatever interesting</li>
</ul>

<p>
on BSD variants.
</p>

<p>
Currently several BSD variants are being developed including FreeBSD,
NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
They are developing/improving network code (<TT>sys/netinet</TT> tree)
separately.
</p>

<p>
Heterogeneity is always important, but we did not have a single shared
reference code for IPv6 networking when we started the project.
In IPv4 days we had had a good reference
implementation, such as UCB Network Releases.
When considering to use IPv6, there had already been several choices.
The problem here was, even if *BSD
projects chose a single IPv6 stack to merge into themselves,
the code would be maintained by each project separately and the code
would likely be quite different on each project tree.
</p>

<p>
We thus formed this project to implement and maintain the best
available code for IPv4/IPv6/IPsec/whatever, which would be the single
base of advanced internetworking technologies.
</p>

<p>
The KAME project was started as a 2-year project (April 1998 - March 2000).
It has got extension for 2 years several times,
so will be until March 2006 at this moment.
</p>

<p>
The core researchers are (in alphabetical order):
</p>

<ul>
<li>Ken'ichi Kudou (<a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/">Fujitsu Limited</a>)
</li>
<li>Shinsuke Suzuki (<a href="http://www.hitachi.co.jp/">Hitachi, Ltd.</a>)
</li>
<li>Jun-ichiro Hagino (<a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/">Internet
Initiative Japan Inc.</a>)
</li>
<li>Kazuhiko Yamamoto (<a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/">Internet
Initiative Japan Inc.</a>)</li>
<li>Keiichi Shima (<a href="http://www.iij.ad.jp/">Internet
Initiative Japan Inc.</a>)</li>
</li>
<li>Keisuke Uehara (<a href="http://www.keio.ac.jp/">Keio University</a>)
</li>
<li>Ryuji Wakikawa (<a href="http://www.keio.ac.jp/">Keio University</a>)
</li>
<li>Koshiro Mitsuya(<a href="http://www.keio.ac.jp/">Keio University</a>)
</li>
<li>Tsuyoshi Momose (<a href="http://www.nec.co.jp/">NEC Corporation</a>)
</li>
<li>Tatuya Jinmei (<a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/">Toshiba
Corporation</a>)
</li>
<li>Shoichi Sakane (<a href="http://www.yokogawa.co.jp/">Yokogawa Electric Corporation</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The core researchers have committed to working on the project as the
primary assignment at their organization (i.e., it is not a hobby for us).
The most important task is to implement the best networking code
possible, under the BSD copyright.
Also note that we provide the achievement as Free software,
since we are much interested in usage of this stack in many ways. 
Thus stability is one of the very important goals for us.
</p>

<p>
KAME's code is based on WIDE <em>Hydrangea</em> IPv6/IPsec stack. We are now
merging several other codes provided by the above researchers,
implementing and improving the software.

<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmaps</h1>

<ul>
<li> Roadmap of year 2005/4-2006/3
<dd>
We will mainly focus on merging our recent development results into
*BSDs in this period, since those are generally stable and matured but
still have been available in KAME snapshots only.
</dd>

<h1 id="release">Releases</h1>

<p>
There are two major sets of KAME-derived releases.
</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="/snap-users/">KAME SNAP</a> for hackers/researchers.
     <dd>
     KAME SNAPs (snapshots) include whole bunch of experimental items, and 
     may not be stable (sometimes do not even compile).
     Snapshots are automatically generated every Monday without
     an explicit announcement.
     If a particular snapshot includes very important changes such as
     a security fix, or when a (subjectively) certain amount of changes
     are accumulated in snapshots, we will make an explicit notice at
     the snap-users mailing list.
     </dd>
</li>
<li> Integrated *BSD source code tree for normal users.
     <dd>
	You just need to install official releases from *BSD projects.

	The following official releases integrate the KAME kit:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> 4.0 and beyond</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> 1.5 and beyond</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> 2.7 and beyond</li>
	<li>BSD/OS 4.2 and beyond (BSD/OS was discontinued, unfortunately)</li>
	</ul>
     </dd>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
A document named
<a href="http://orange.kame.net/dev/cvsweb2.cgi/kame/COVERAGE?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">COVERAGE</a>
is supplied with KAME kits, and gives gory details about differences
between KAME/*BSD and *BSD official releases.
</p>

<p>
In the past we had KAME STABLE and KAME RELEASE kits.
<a href="ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/mail-list/snap-users/3306">
They were discontinued</a>.
