<H1>Overview of KAME Project</H1>
</A>
KAME Project is a joint effort to create single solid software set,
especially targeted at IPv6/IPsec.  Talented researchers from several
Japanese major companies joined the project.  This joint effort will
avoid unnecessary duplicated development in same area, and effectively
provides high quality, advanced featured package. 

<P>

KAME Project aims to provide FREE reference implementations of

<UL>
<LI> IPv6
<LI> IPsec (for both IPv4 and IPv6)
<LI> advanced internetworking such as advanced packet queuing,
ATM, mobility, and whatever interesting
</UL>

on BSD variants.

<P>

Currently several BSD variants are being developed including FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, and BSDI as commercial product.  They are
developing/improving network code (<TT>sys/netinet</TT> tree) separately.

<P>

Heterogeneity is important, but currently we do not have single shared
reference code for networking.  In IPv4 days we had good reference
code, such as UCB Network Releases.  When consider to use IPv6, there
are several choices already. The problem here is, even if *BSD
projects choose a single IPv6 stack to merge into them,
the code will be maintained by
each project separately and these code likely to be quite different on
each project tree.

<P>

We thus formed a project to implement and maintain the best
available code for IPv4/IPv6/IPsec/whatever, which will be the basis
of advanced internetworking in the 21st century.

<P>

KAME project was started as a 2-year project (April 1998 - March 2000).
It has got extension for 2 years TWICE,
so will be until March 2004 at this moment.
Core researchers are from the following companies (in alphabetical order):
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.fujitsu.com/">Fujitsu Limited</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.hitachi.co.jp/">Hitachi, Ltd.</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.iij.ad.jp/">Internet Initiative Japan Inc.</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.nec.co.jp/">NEC Corporation</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/">Toshiba Corporation</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.yokogawa.co.jp/">Yokogawa Electric Corporation</A>
</UL>
Core researchers have
committed to work on the IPv6 stack more than 3 days per week, in
full-time manner.  Therefore, the project is the primary task for the
core researchers (it is not a hobby for us).  The primary task for
them is to implement the best networking code possible, under BSD
copyright. Also note that we provide the achievement as Free software,
we're much interested in usage of this stack in many ways. 
Thus stability is one of the very important goal for us.

<P>

KAME's code is based on WIDE <I>Hydrangea</I> IPv6/IPsec stack. We are now
merging several other codes provided by above researchers,
implementing and improving the software.

<A NAME=release><H1>Releasing Plan</H1></A>

We plan to release KAME kit in two ways:

<DL>
<DT><I><A HREF="/snap-users/">SNAP</I></A> is for hackers/researchers.
<DD>	Will be released once a week (every Monday).
	It will include whole bunch of experimental items.
	It may not be stable (sometimes doesn't even compile).

	We develop KAME code on top of 4 BSD variants, and 5 different versions:
	<UL>
	<LI>BSD/OS 3.1 and 4.3
	<LI>FreeBSD 4.8 (from the next SNAP)
	<LI>NetBSD 1.6
	<LI>OpenBSD 3.2
	</UL>

	We share most of IPv6/IPsec code among *BSD platforms,
	so they are in-sync in most cases.

<DT><I>Integrated *BSD source code tree</I>
<DD>	For normal users.
	You just need to install official releases from *BSD projects.

	The following official releases integrates KAME kit:
	<UL>
	<LI><A HREF=http://www.freebsd.org/>FreeBSD</A> 4.0 and beyond
	<LI><A HREF=http://www.netbsd.org/>NetBSD</A> 1.5 and beyond
	<LI><A HREF=http://www.openbsd.org/>OpenBSD</A> 2.7 and beyond
	<LI><A HREF=http://www.bsdi.com/>BSD/OS</A> 4.2 and beyond
	</UL>

</DL>

<P>

The difference between KAME SNAP kit and *BSD releses would be like below:
<OL>
<LI>KAME SNAP kit comes with more experimental protocols/APIs support and
	userland programs.
	This would attract researchers more, as not everything in
	KAME tree will be merged into *BSD tree (due to discussions, spec
	maturity, and other reasons).
<LI>KAME kit will always be based on public release version of *BSD, so you
	can enjoy latest IPv6 tree on top of stable *BSD platforms.
	This would be nice feature to have when your goal is to do IPv6
	experiment, not to chase *BSD-current.
<LI>The merged *BSD releases will give tightly integrated IPv6-ready operating
	system.
	KAME kit is supplied as diffs to *BSD release versions,
	so it has less integrated feeling (we are trying our best, though).
</OL>
In other words, even if *BSD group ships KAME-integrated official releases,
we will continue our work and ship KAME kit for them.
<P>

A document named
<A HREF=http://www.kame.net/dev/cvsweb.cgi/kame/COVERAGE>COVERAGE</A>
is supplied with KAME kits, and gives gory details about differences
between KAME/*BSD and *BSD official releases.

<P>

In the past we had KAME STABLE and KAME RELEASE kits.
<A HREF=ftp://ftp.kame.net/pub/mail-list/snap-users/3306>
They were discontinued</A>.
